139723339,Managing Obsolescence And Supply Chain Disruption,"MANAGING OBSOLESCENCE AND SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION By Neil Ballinger, Head of Global Operations, EU Automation The early 21st century has seen global supply chain disruption on an unprecedented scale. The recent pandemic may have abated, but its aftershocks are still being felt by manufacturers and industrial automation engineers around the world. Microchip shortages and skills shortfalls are now being compounded by rising energy costs and soaring inflation. Geopolitics is leading to more complex trading conditions and tariffs. In addition, the rapid evolution of disruptive new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) is accelerating component obsolescence. What is the role of supply chain management? For businesses to thrive in such challenging conditions, it is essential to have a supply chain that is sufficiently robust and agile enough to weather the storms of market adversity and respond to new opportunities. Supply chain management is essentially about managing risk. It relies on lifecycle forecasting to identify the impact of failure or obsolescence on the business. Identifying risks allows you to develop planned, preventative actions for when parts, spares and software fail or become obsolete. What are the consequences of poor supply chain management? The inability to source and replace critical parts efficiently results in loss of production capacity, a significant increase in lifecycle costs, reduced credibility with customers, lower profitability, and loss of reputation. By contrast, a company that has a robust supply chain management strategy in place is likely to have a preventative maintenance plan that guarantees minimal downtime, ready access to a stock of parts requiring frequent replacement, and the ability to offer its customers guarantees around availability and delivery times, which gives it a competitive edge. What are the fundamentals of good supply chain management? Know your strengths and weaknesses. Take the time to assess your systems and predict what components may need replacing, and when. And what about your people? If your supply chain manager was off sick or left the company, what impact would that have on the business? Have a plan to manage the risks. Planning ahead rather than reacting to failures gives you a competitive advantage over around three quarters of your rivals! Use suppliers you can trust. Suppliers with a proven track record of supporting products are the bedrock of good supply chain management. It also helps to avoid fitting sub-standard parts, whose poor quality could lead to more unplanned downtime. Do I have the capacity to develop my own supply chain strategy? Supply chain management involves a multi-disciplinary approach and requires considerable time to get right, so be absolutely sure you have what it takes. Can you develop your own dedicated global network of credible, verified suppliers? And can you do that for every Manufacturer group you’ll ever need today and in the future?Do you have inhouse experts in the fields of legislation, electrical compatibility, import and export documentation and international certifications, as well as those working on the logistics and maintenance side, to cover all supply chain aspects?If your machines are older, do you also need a dedicated Obsolescence Manager to track down and secure parts that are no longer available?Can you continuously maintain up-to-date records of all your components and where to source them? Also, be aware that the price of failure can be very high. In addition to the ongoing cost of supporting an internal supply chain function, calculate the likely cost in lost production, in the wages of employees sitting idle and lost reputation with customers if your supply chain processes should fail before making your decision. If you have all the expertise and resources available, then proceed to build and manage your own supply chain. For those businesses who find that on balance internal supply chain management is not feasible there is the option to outsource the function to an external specialist. What are the benefits of working with an external supply chain partner? External specialists like EU Automation support businesses by acting as their supply chain management function. For example, as a global distributor of automation parts we specialise in the procurement of essential and scarce components through a global supply network of more than 100 parts manufacturers. We use our expert knowledge and extensive procurement contacts to source and deliver the parts our customers need in order to minimise disruption and keep their production lines running. We recently helped an Australian pharmaceutical customer to track down a critical but obsolete central processing unit. He travelled by aeroplane to our Frankfurt hub to collect it. While in transit, he was told a second unit had failed. We managed to source a second unit too, and had both of them ready to hand over when he arrived. We also helped to arrange his accommodation and return flight. His business was up and running again 72 hours later, saving thousands of dollars. External supply chain partners can also add value by anticipating wider threats and opportunities. For example, cybersecurity is a growing concern. The UK government famously banned Huawei from its 5G network development due to supply chain and security issues. As manufacturing becomes more connected, new risks arise. EU Automation helps businesses keep their hardware and software up to date to minimise the risk of cyber-attacks. We have robust systems in place for traceability: so our customers can be confident that they are sourcing quality parts with full warranties, minimising risk. Sustainability is also growing in importance. The traditional linear approach of make, use and dispose is no longer acceptable, so businesses need to find ways they can demonstrably support a circular economy. Supply chain management can make a significant contribution. When an industrial plant closes, it contains hundreds, if not thousands, of useful working parts: some of which are no longer manufactured. As part of our own commitment to recycle and reuse, we provide a way for businesses to access and purchase these parts once they’ve been reconditioned, extending the lifecycle of their machines and reducing waste. What is the future of supply chain management? The uncertainties that have disrupted supply chains in recent years will take time to dissipate, but manufacturers can expect to see a return to proven just-in-time methods for general wear and tear parts soon, with only critical spares being held on site. In future, it is likely that the rate of obsolescence will accelerate, driven by rapid developments in connective technologies. This may also lead to an increase in supply chain outsourcing to take advantage of the agility, resources and expertise inherent in companies dedicated to the task. EU Automation is well-placed to support businesses through any supply chain challenges. We have a dedicated database of globally available stock (new, second-hand and scarce), together with latest pricing information and lead-in times. Customers can access the parts they require via our committed team of account managers, who provide efficient local support in the relevant native language. Together, our global supply network and local support offices give reassurance that, if the unexpected does occur, we have the people and the processes in place to source the part you need to keep your business running.

142005631,Import and Export of Temperature Sensitive Products to Propel Cold Chain Packaging Demand at US$ 103.7 Billion by 2033,"Germany's cold chain packaging market is set to expand 3.6x by 2033, propelled by its leading position in European and global pharmaceutical markets NEWARK, DELAWARE, UNITED STATES, September 7, 2023/EINPresswire.com/ -- The Cold Chain Packaging Market is a crucial segment within the global logistics and supply chain industry. It plays a pivotal role in preserving the integrity of temperature-sensitive products during transportation and storage. This market has been witnessing significant growth due to several factors. One key driver is the increasing demand for pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products that require strict temperature control to maintain their efficacy. As the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors continue to expand, so does the need for reliable cold-chain packaging solutions. In 2023, it is predicted that the market for cold chain packaging will reach US$ 26.1 billion. It is estimated to continue expanding between 2023 and 2033 at a CAGR of 14.8%. In 2033, the market is projected to be worth more than US$ 103.7 billion. Pharmaceutical products that seem to be temperature sensitive should be safeguarded throughout shipping against rough handling, harsh weather, and other unforeseen circumstances. They need to be maintained with a stable temperature range. Request our sample report and gain a competitive advantage in this flourishing industry! https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-12906 Pharmaceuticals have a complicated supply chain that necessitates attention to numerous small aspects during transit and delivery. Pharmaceutical supplies must be transported to warehouses at specific temperatures. They must also be properly assembled and sorted before being delivered to the appropriate pharmacies. Adopting cold chain packaging solutions for the transportation of temperature-sensitive goods allows for flexibility in routing and simplicity in handling. It can also reduce the risk of transit-related damage. Numerous companies are set to launch different types of measures to track vaccine waste at the national level. These initiatives concentrate on the safe handling and delivery of vaccines. Third-party logistics service providers have adopted several cold chain packaging solutions as a result, thereby boosting the market. The global pharmaceuticals sector is expanding quickly as a result of rapid globalization and the development of low-cost medications. Government agencies from all over the world are urging individuals to shift to generic medications and bio-equivalent pharmaceuticals. This is mainly taking pace as they are substantially less expensive but still necessitate cold chain packaging and transportation. Key Takeaways of the Cold Chain Packaging Market Insulated containers segment by product type is anticipated to hold more than 1/3rd of the cold chain packaging market share by 2023. Reusable packaging formats are projected to exhibit a CAGR of 0% between 2023 and 2033. Polymer segment by material type is likely to account for around 3/5th of the cold chain packaging market share in 2033. By end user, the food segment is estimated to create an incremental opportunity of US$ 17 billion in the forecast period. Germany's cold chain packaging market is likely to surge 6 times its present rate in the assessment period. “Lightweight shippers that provide high volume efficiency tend to offer financial benefits such as low transportation cost due to low shipping weight. To reduce overall cost, manufacturers should select shippers with high payload capacity. Reusable cold chain packaging helps in reducing cost per use and enhances profitability margins for manufacturers,” says a lead analyst at Future Market Insights. Request Methodology to Get a Comprehensive View of the Cold Chain Packaging Market! https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/request-report-methodology/rep-gb-12906 Efficient Pallet Shippers to Become an Ideal Choice for Manufacturers to Fulfil Ultra Low-Temperature Requirements Numerous pharmaceutical treatments designed to treat uncommon diseases frequently contain valuable components with a limited shelf life. They also contain severe temperature specifications such as a temperature range of -40 to -150 degrees Celsius. Demand for pallet shippers that provide safe delivery of such materials is hence anticipated to increase as the use of medicinal products with ultra-low temperature ranges increases. Businesses can take advantage of this opportunity to the fullest by creating packaging options tailored to this product category and gain a sizable competitive edge. Pallet shippers are traditional heavy-duty metal boxes that are actively handled and have substantial transportation issues for lengthy multi-modal routes. They are utilized for air freight shipping. Nevertheless, numerous businesses have recently released passive pallet shippers that make use of high-density polyurethane insulation technology. For bulk shipments, this results in convenience, dependability, and value. Key cold chain packaging solution providers have a great chance in this market to produce effective passive pallet shippers as active competitors are expensive and insufficient for remote transportation needs. Expansion of Rental Businesses to Create New Opportunities for Cold Chain Packaging Companies The market has recently seen a trend where companies offering cold chain packaging solutions are rapidly broadening their rental business. They are relatively less focused on new product sales. Purchasing these still constitutes an unfeasible and environmentally unsound option for numerous end users. This is due to the high costs of insulated containers and shippers, as well as environmental risks associated with their disposal. In a few nations, especially Germany, it is illegal to dispose of expanded polystyrene and polyurethane rigid foam. Doing so incurs additional costs. For cold chain packaging, a variety of end users choose to lease or rent shippers or containers. Manufacturers of shippers and containers, on the other hand, experience high returns on their investments and low cost of ownership. It can lead to high profit margins. But, this technique is still not cost-effective unless a business has a closed-loop system. Establishing depots in numerous areas is necessary for the firm to succeed. For instance, Together along with Yusen Logistics Pte. Ltd., Va-Q-tec AG developed a temperature-controlled container leasing facility in Singapore. Credo on demand is indeed a pallet shipper renting program that was established by Pelican Biothermal. Competition Landscape: Cold Chain Packaging Market Sonoco ThermoSafe, Pelican Products, Inc., Sofrigam SAS, Sealed Air Corporation, Cryopak Industries Inc., and CSafe Global, LLC are key players operating in the cold chain packaging market. Few of the other noticeable players in the market include Softbox Systems Ltd., TOWER Cold Chain Solutions, DGP Intelsius LLC, TemperPack Technologies, Inc., Tempack Packaging Solutions SL, Dokasch Temperature Solutions, Cold Chain Technologies, Insulated Products Corporation., Engineered Packaging, Inc. dba Chill-Pak, CoolPac, Orora Packaging Solutions, and others.

145019145,EV Makers’ Use Of Chinese Suppliers Raises Concerns About Forced Labor - WorldNewsEra,"Tesla boasts that its electric vehicles are a marvel not just of innovation but also ethics, pledging in annual reports that it will “not knowingly accept products or services from suppliers that include forced labour or human trafficking in any form.” The carmaker touts its teams of monitors that travel to mining operations around the world, and has pledged to mount a camera at an African mine to prevent the use of underage or slave labor. But Tesla has been conspicuously silent when it comes to China, despite evidence that materials that go into its vehicles come from the Xinjiang region, where forced labor has been rampant. Firms that appear to undermine a U.S. ban on products made in Xinjiang emerge near the top of Tesla’s sprawling network of suppliers, according to a Washington Post examination of corporate records and Chinese media reports. Among them are companies that have openly complied with China’s quotas for moving minority Muslim Uyghurs out of rural villages and into factory towns through what Chinese authorities call “labor transfers” or “surplus labor employment.” Tesla is among several EV companies that have suppliers with Xinjiang connections, records show. Ford has a deal with a battery maker that congressional investigators allege has ties to vast lithium mining and processing operations in Xinjiang, and Volkswagen operates a factory in the region with a Chinese partner. Though not all labor in Xinjiang is forced, China’s lockdown on information flowing from the region led the U.S. government last year to bar the import of any Xinjiang-made parts and products out of a concern they could be made with coerced labor. The companies’ kid-glove approach on China and potential violations of U.S. law come as the White House and powerful congressional committees scrutinize the EV industry, which is booming as automakers race to gain the upper hand in the transition to climate-friendly battery-powered engines. The situation in Xinjiang is a key point of tension in the strained relationship between China and the West, as the United States and allies step up enforcement of penalties on industries operating there. EVs are widely considered vital for confronting climate change, and the companies that make them are at an inflection point. The contracts and accountability measures they lock in now could affect communities around the world for decades. Many experts warn that companies are failing to ensure that their supply chains are free of forced labor, washing their hands of responsibility for upstream suppliers they shrug off as out of their managerial reach. “We know from every other industry there is that if we don’t fix this now, in the early days of this transition, it will be a massive mistake,” said Duncan Jepson, a lawyer and supply-chain management expert. “But the auto companies are not giving much hope they are willing to do anything to make a difference.” Automakers say they take pains to ensure that their suppliers are not sourcing from Xinjiang. Their efforts are hampered by China’s lack of transparency and demands that companies doing business there fall in line with the country’s industrial and ethnic policies even when they conflict with Western laws. And they say the vast web of up to 13,000 companies that provide materials is difficult to vet. Yet evidence of sourcing from Xinjiang lies not very deep in their supply chains, The Post found. Chinese supply chains that provide the industry with materials for batteries, bodies and wheels include companies that openly use Xinjiang labor, according to The Post’s examination. The extraction and processing of materials used in EV manufacture, such as lithium, manganese and bauxite, are rapidly expanding, posing a test for company policies that tout respect for human rights and the environment. Tepid enforcement has contributed to the exploitation of workers in the cobalt mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the destruction of livelihoods in the villages of Guinea and the potential enrichment of the repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The shifting of Uyghurs from rural areas to factory towns has been part of a larger crackdown in Xinjiang, mounted by the Chinese government and aided by private industry. In recent years, Muslim minorities have been forced into reeducation camps where, rights investigators say, they undergo political indoctrination and military-style training. Many of the reeducation camps have emptied since the peak of the repression in the late 2010s. But the United Nations said last year that the continued mass detentions may constitute crimes against humanity, and the United States accuses Beijing of genocide. China’s secrecy and threats of penalties for those who cooperate with human rights inquiries make it nearly impossible to verify if workers in a factory or mine are there by choice. Against that backdrop, the United States last year implemented the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which treats all manufacturing in Xinjiang as tainted by forced labor unless firms can prove otherwise. Particular scrutiny is falling on Tesla because of its market dominance and conscientious image. “Tesla is proclaiming one thing in its sustainability reports and English-language pronouncements and then doing something totally different,” said Nathan Picarsic, a co-founder of Horizon Advisory, a geopolitical risk advisory firm that worked with The Post to map EV company links to Xinjiang. Tesla did not respond to detailed questions from The Post. At a May investor meeting, chief executive Elon Musk promised to place a webcam at a Congo cobalt mine but ignored calls from shareholder groups for the company to disclose and sever ties with firms suspected of using forced labor in Xinjiang. On its website, the company says it continues “to map our complex supply chains to understand their origins. New suppliers are required to disclose the details of their supply chains so we can verify sources and identify risks via third-party audits.” Tesla relies on China as a supplier, but also a market for its top-selling EVs. It sells about 40 percent of its new cars in the country. “The risk of not being able to sell in China is crippling to Tesla,” said an industry supply-chain consultant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly. “There are just red lines Tesla cannot cross because of that. Talking about the problem of forced labor publicly is one of them. They might be working on the issue privately, but if they are, they won’t be talking about it.” Chinese companies supply nearly 40 percent of the materials for batteries that go into Teslas worldwide, according to Nikkei Asia, a financial newspaper that scrutinized more than 13,000 companies in the Tesla supply chain. Researchers at the Helena Kennedy Center for International Justice at Sheffield Hallam University in Britain found that a complex web of suppliers and middlemen allows Tesla and several other companies to source material from Xinjiang without buying directly from there. “We knew that there was forced labor built into the whole program,” said Kendyl Salcito, a co-author of the center’s report. “But we didn’t know it would touch on so many commodities and parts. We hadn’t actually understood how horrific the spread of forced labor was in this sector.” A battery supply chain The Post examined several Chinese supply chains that provide the EV industry with lithium for batteries; aluminum for batteries, bodies and wheels; and graphene, a lightweight material used in batteries and bodies. Each chain originated with companies that openly operate in Xinjiang using local labor. One of those chains involves the world’s largest EV battery maker, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, based in Ningde, on China’s east coast. CATL’s products power hundreds of thousands of Teslas assembled in both China and North America. It also has contracts with at least six other major global automakers. CATL has already attracted scrutiny from U.S. officials because of its business relationship with Xinjiang Zhicun Lithium, one of the largest lithium carbonate producers in China. CATL’s collaboration with Ford on a new battery plant in Michigan has triggered forced-labor inquiries from two influential House committees and a group of Republican senators. While there are large lithium deposits around the world, much of the refining and processing happens in China, where three-quarters of the world’s lithium-ion batteries are made. China is expanding those sectors in Xinjiang, and Zhicun is a big part of that effort. In the past few months alone, Zhicun has poured more than $1 billion into the region, according to corporate disclosures and media reports in China. A confidential report to investors from a Chinese research firm lays out Zhicun’s growth in Xinjiang, detailing four major acquisitions in the region’s mining belts, some of them in partnership with government authorities. The report, which was written in February, was shared with The Post by a researcher on the condition that the author’s name and firm not be disclosed, as the person could be at risk of prosecution under China’s anti-sanctions laws. The report warns clients that if U.S. regulators become aware of the scope of Zhicun’s involvement in Xinjiang, it could trigger seizures of products. Auto industry suppliers such as Zhicun are a linchpin of the Chinese government’s policies in Xinjiang. The information they share with Chinese news outlets and on social media platforms has included photos of ethnic-minority laborers transferred to the factory cities of Xinjiang. Recent local press coverage of Zhicun emphasizes how the company is facilitating “rural employment of surplus labor” and is helping government officials “strengthen the transfer of employment of the rural labor force.” Such phrases are not an admission that labor is forced but are seen by investigators as indicating there is a high risk. Refusing a labor transfer order can lead to internment, activists say. Officials from other companies have shared details about months-long ideological and military-style training programs their workers complete. CATL said in a statement that it hasn’t had a relationship with Zhicun since selling its stake in the lithium company this year. It said it “opposes and prohibits any forms of forced labor in the operations of CATL and our suppliers.” The company said that it has an audit program to assess the sustainability of its suppliers and that it has joined the U.N. Global Compact, a voluntary initiative in which companies pledge to support human rights. But days after CATL’s sale of Zhicun closed, a limited partnership run by a former senior manager at CATL “with the financial support of CATL and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries” purchased a majority stake in Zhicun, according to House investigators. Zhicun did not respond to questions from The Post. Ford, which has entered into a licensing agreement with CATL, said in a statement that there are no Zhicun materials in its supply chain, and that Ford will “continue to engage CATL to prevent and, if necessary, address human rights issues in their supply chain.” An aluminum supply chain A second supply chain examined by The Post focuses on the provision of aluminum. One company that has emerged as a red flag for researchers is Shandong Nanshan Aluminum, based in Yantai, on China’s northeastern coast, which supplies metal for EV batteries and exteriors to Tesla and several other automakers, as well as CATL. Shandong Nanshan appears to be buying and shipping aluminum from smelters in Xinjiang through another company and a joint venture, according to evidence uncovered by the Sheffield Hallam researchers. A separate review of Chinese public financial disclosures by Horizon suggests that Shandong Nanshan and a subsidiary have been major buyers from a Xinjiang industrial giant called Xinjiang Zhonghe Co., which is deeply involved in carrying out the Chinese government’s labor transfer programs. Shandong Nanshan did not respond to a detailed list of questions from The Post. Xinjiang Zhonghe, which did not respond to questions either, has been open about its role in China’s ethnic policies. The company in 2019 was among those that set up “vocational” training centers. Investigators from the United Nations’ Economic and Social Council warned in March that some of Xinjiang’s vocational centers have functioned more like prisons. A top official at Xinjiang Zhonghe in September 2021 received an award from the regional government for embracing “the [Communist] Party’s ethnic policies” and helping secure “an ideological Great Wall for safeguarding national unity and ethnic unity.” Xinjiang Zhonghe works with the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, or XPCC, a paramilitary organization that carries out the Communist Party’s repression in the region. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the XPCC in 2020, accusing it of “implementing a comprehensive surveillance, detention, and indoctrination program targeting Uyghurs and members of other ethnic minority groups.” The Chinese government denied the allegations and retaliated with sanctions against Western officials. Xinjiang Zhonghe also reported in financial disclosures in 2020 and 2021 that its major customers included a Chinese firm called Beijing WKW Automotive Parts. Beijing WKW, which did not respond to written questions, has a deal to supply exterior parts to a Tesla factory in Shanghai. Beijing WKW reported in its financial disclosures in China that Xinjiang Zhonghe was a top supplier from 2014 to 2019, after which the company stopped revealing the names of its top suppliers. Another supply chain for EV metals A third supply chain examined by The Post centers on Xinjiang Zhongtai Group, a huge industrial player in China that supplies the EV industry with aluminum and graphene. The company openly embraced Uyghur labor transfers as recently as 2020. As Uyghur repression was intensifying in 2017, the company reported that it had transferred “2,000 surplus workers” to its industrial parks in Urumqi and Korla from Kashgar and Hotan, both about 900 miles away. The article highlighted how workers were taught to “appreciate the kindness of the [Communist] party” and participated in military-style training. The Uyghurs, who speak their own Turkic language, were also required to learn Mandarin and adhere to the “three loves and three antis — love the Party, love the motherland, love the big family of Chinese nationals; anti-separatism, anti-violence, and anti-extremism.” In separate photos, groups of workers from a rural village — some pinned with big red flowers, others in military fatigues — are exhorted as they board buses and trains headed for the factory to strive toward Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s expectations for social stability. Postings in 2020 showed transferred workers in face masks at a facility where they were undergoing up to six months of training in such topics as “national unity” and “ideological and moral education.” The U.S. Department of Homeland Security in June placed the publicly traded arm of Xinjiang Zhongtai on its list of companies whose products cannot be imported under any condition, as a result of its “working with the government of Xinjiang to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor or receive forced labor or Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, or members of other persecuted groups out of Xinjiang.” Robert Silvers, the department’s undersecretary for policy, put U.S. companies on notice at the time that ties to the Chinese suppliers would have consequences. “Businesses must know their supply chains,” he said. Xinjiang Zhongtai did not respond to questions from The Post. But enforcement of such rules is inconsistent. The auto industry has been able to work around the Biden administration’s ban on investments in, and certain business partnerships with, major suppliers to the Chinese military, including China South Industries Group Corp., a firm that sells weapons and also is a large auto manufacturer. A review of EV maker connections to the Chinese military, commissioned by The Post from the firm Strategy Risks, revealed that Ford nonetheless remains in a major joint venture with a subsidiary of China South Industries Group. The partnership, which operates under the name Changan Ford Automobile Co. Ltd., employs 13,000 people making EVs and other cars in China. Ford said it is in compliance with the White House order, as it is not an investor in Changan or China South Industries Group. “Changan is one of China’s largest publicly traded auto companies with most of the shares held by the public,” a statement from Ford said. “When Ford entered the China market more than 20 years ago, Ford and Changan created an independent joint venture as required to manufacture and distribute Ford vehicles.” Experts shocked As international condemnation and investor concern mount over Uyghur-made products infiltrating global supply chains, Chinese companies have become more selective about the information they share revealing participation in the mass transfer of “surplus” Uyghur labor, according to Adrian Zenz, a scholar who has compiled some of the most vivid evidence of what the U.S. government calls genocide. Photos of indoctrination ceremonies and military-style training on social media have given way to reports of job fairs and employee success stories. Zenz this year presented research before Congress finding that while many of the reeducation centers have closed, the repression is taking other forms — including outright imprisonment, stepped-up surveillance and restriction of movement — as “intrusive and coercive labor placement and retention mechanisms are being intensified rather than dismantled.” The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, part of the federal government, found the same this year. China has meanwhile prohibited investigators from accessing the region and threatens harsh penalties for anyone who helps companies operating in China investigate their exposure to forced labor. The extent to which Xinjiang labor has seeped into the broader EV supply chain has shocked even experts who have long studied the region. The Sheffield Hallam report detailed the links that most major auto companies now have, finding that every one of them is at high risk of making cars that use forced labor. The report touched off a Senate Finance Committee investigation into auto companies’ ties to forced labor in Xinjiang. “There is no excuse,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the committee’s chair. “This is a place where the Chinese government is committing genocide. … These companies are not going to be able to get on top of their forced-labor problem by papering it over with a bunch of marketing gloss.” The targets of Wyden’s committee include Volkswagen, which is among the non-Chinese automakers most closely linked to Xinjiang. The company, which relies on sales in China for nearly half its revenue, operates a plant together with a Chinese firm in Xinjiang. Volkswagen said in a statement to The Post that it has found no evidence of forced labor in its operations there and plans an independent audit. Wyden said the responses the committee is receiving from the carmakers reveal that EV companies do very little to apply their ethics codes to the lion’s share of businesses that make their parts. They typically vet their suppliers by asking them to fill out a questionnaire. “These questionnaires are hilarious,” said Salcito, the co-author of the Sheffield Hallam report. “They include questions like, ‘Do you employ forced labor? Do you employ children?’ You’ll be shocked to learn the answer is always no.” Several experts interviewed said EV companies risk a reckoning similar to that of solar panel firms, which plunged into crisis last year as U.S. agents seized more than 1,000 shipments over concerns of possible forced labor in Xinjiang and other trade violations. Automakers are addressing the issues with varying degrees of urgency. Researchers at Sheffield Hallam and the nonprofit Lead the Charge, which ranks EV companies for supply-chain ethics, pointed to Mercedes-Benz as an example of a company that is working hard to address human rights problems in its supply chain. The company has aggressive auditing targets, sends teams to investigate abuses reported at upstream suppliers, and gives its sustainability team considerable clout in the corporate office. Ford argues that it does many of those same things and has one of the industry’s most comprehensive systems tracing raw materials from mines to assembly plants. Tesla helped launch a mapping program to show customers the origins of the cobalt in one of its batteries. Volvo, which disputes findings by Sheffield Hallam that at least six of its suppliers have links to forced labor, says it is using blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to locate problems. “Mapping our supply chain is an immense work, which is an equally important as challenging task,” said a statement from Volvo. “The supply chains are complex, global and dynamic. Hence, this is a way of working that has no end date.” Tracking EV materials There’s still heated debate, though, over whether the industry is up to the task of honestly confronting human and environmental exploitation in the production of EVs, considering how rampant they remain. And there is suspicion by even many inside the industry that some of the mapping and tracing initiatives automakers are unveiling are more driven by the hope of keeping regulators at bay than boosting accountability. Such concerns have moved the European Union to mandate that by 2026 all EVs come equipped with a “battery passport” that details the origin of materials in the battery, along with its carbon footprint. “Some in the industry are saying tracing these things through the supply chain can’t be done. [Though] it may not be easy … it is nowhere close to impossible,” said Doug Johnson-Poensgen, chief executive of Circulor, a supply-chain monitoring firm advising European regulators. “Everybody is going to have to do this.” Johnson-Poensgen says new technologies enable auto companies and their suppliers to track materials through each step in the production process, setting off alarms if sustainably mined minerals are mixed with other minerals, for example. The tracking systems sort through reams of data to determine if there are local labor or environmental violations at facilities. Satellites can use cameras to help monitor the operations and who is coming and going from them. Some major suppliers and automakers, though, are lobbying the E.U. to allow the industry to design and enforce battery-passport rules, rather than subjecting their reports to independent review. Jepson, who has deep experience helping companies use technology to confront modern slavery, said the ability of shoestring-budget operations like Horizon and Sheffield Hallam to discover forced-labor connections that car companies haven’t found shows that the firms are not trying hard enough. “You are going to tell me a tiny [nongovernmental organization] can find out what is happening with your suppliers and you can’t?” he said. “For car companies to say they don’t have the technology or manpower to figure this out is nonsense.”",https://worldnewsera.com/news/entrepreneurs/ev-makers-use-of-chinese-suppliers-raises-concerns-about-forced-labor/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CC4L56TAC5CTSLAUJKU7YYBLL4.jpg&w=1200,2023-09-18 23:32:52,Laurie Foti,en,us,-0.122

141234683,"With automotive supply chains stabilizing, focus on","Press contact:Florence LievreTel.: +33 1 47 54 50 71Email: florence.lievre@capgemini.com With automotive supply chains stabilizing, focus on sustainability expected to rise back up automakers’ agendas Auto organizations are more confident to tackle future supply chain disruptions, having slashed backlog orders by 61%. A further 39% reduction is predicted in the next year. Nearshoring1 strategies expected to be reinforced, driven notably by the adoption of electric- and software-defined vehicles and the evolution of regulatory and government policies. While sustainability and the circular economy are key components of the supply chains of the future, less than half of organizations have deployed initiatives in the past 12 months, and only 13% of these are being actively scaled. Paris, September 4, 2023 – According to the latest report “The automotive supply chain: Pursuing long-term resilience” from the Capgemini Research Institute, automotive organizations now feel more confident to tackle future supply chain disruptions. To achieve this, automakers have been forced to rethink, restructure, and refinance their supply chain management. While issues have been stabilized in the short-term, supply chains are still transforming due to their complexity and evolving factors: the acceleration of electric vehicle (EV) production, the new regulatory and government policies, and the adoption of more software-based features like ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems2), increasing the demand for semiconductors. A global re-orchestration is underway as procurement from offshore3 locations fell by 22% in the past two years. Europe leads this trend having reduced offshore procurement by a quarter since 2021. This is followed by APAC and the US who have reduced offshore sourcing by 20% and 18% respectively. The report finds that automotive organizations expect procurement from offshoring locations to reduce by a further 19% by 2025, as electric vehicle production surges and the fabrication of key electronics components relocates. Sustainability efforts are faltering in the automotive supply chainSuccessive supply chain crises have sapped automakers’ time and diverted focus and investment away from sustainability initiatives. Consequently, sustainability is not currently considered a priority for many of them, with only 37% of respondents stating that issues such as carbon footprint management and environmental risk influence supply chain decision-making. Investment across the industry reflects this trend and while OEMs’ total investment in supply chain sustainability is on par with last year, suppliers’ annual investment has significantly reduced by 17%. While sustainability and circularity are key components for building a more resilient supply chain and to future-proof operations, the scaling of circular-economy initiatives has been delayed due to a shortage of suppliers of recycled materials (and of the materials themselves). Automotive organizations need to balance sustainability and circular economy with factors like cost and affordability. According to the report, digital solutions can help address this delicate balance between these various competing factors. The creation of new supply chains for semiconductors and electric vehicles will accelerate nearshoringDriven by a surge in efforts to deliver software-based features and services, the average proportion of vehicle value attributed to semiconductors and sensors increased by 51% over the last two years. This is expected to increase by a further 46% between 2023 and 2025. However, only half of OEMs consider the current supply of semiconductor components as secure. Of those surveyed, 70% said the majority of supply is currently being obtained from China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. In a bid to achieve a greater level of supply-security OEMs are investing in alternative supply methods and moving away from tier-1 and -2 suppliers. Similarly, OEMs have secured only three years of EV battery raw materials on average. Inventory building has stabilized but is not a feasible strategy in the long-term According to the report, half of OEMs feel confident that they would be able to avoid 60% of the revenue loss they incurred in 2022 if the same scenarios – including the semiconductor shortage – happened again today. To address operational and logistic issues, both suppliers and OEMs have adopted strategies based on adding operational investment and working capital. This is led by the building of inventories, which 81% of suppliers and 44% of OEMs have implemented. However, it’s clear that this is unsustainable in the long-term as holding excessive inventory risks a variety of negative effects on the operational and financial wellbeing of automotive organizations. A lack of a data-driven intelligent supply chains impedes the automotive industry’s goal for long-term resilience.Visibility and transparency are key to create a more trustworthy supplier ecosystem – just over half (53%) of respondents have a mature intelligent supply chain in place to enable data-driven decision making, allowing for the integration of newer technologies such as AI and data analytics. With growing participation in standardized, open, and trusted data ecosystems that include new suppliers for software driven services, automotive organizations can further progress resilience and sustainability ambitions. Alexandre Audoin, Global Head of Automotive Industry at Capgemini, comments; “Over the past few years, organizations have been forced to restructure and refinance supply chain management on the fly in order to navigate multiple disruptions from all fronts. While in a more positive place today, automakers need to look at delivering a long-term, intelligent, and data-driven strategy that will build resilience and competitive advantage. More so, this needs to incorporate circularity as an essential component, not only to help organizations navigate regulatory changes, but to embed new players in the supply chain ecosystem and also achieve ambitious climate-targets.” For more information or to download the report, visit: link to report.

141687585,India’s gain could be China’s loss in the great supply chain reallocation,"Globalisation is being rewired, from how it operates to what it fundamentally means. Reshoring remains a dominant topic. Discussions at August’s Jackson Hole economic symposium in the US centred around structural shifts in the global economy, with speeches focused on the looming “great reallocation”. Broadly speaking, data continues to highlight that companies have diversified their supply chains, with plans for much more to come. Supply chain localisation, amid trade tensions, geopolitics, energy security and the risk of supply chain disruptions, is likely to remain a key theme for the next decade. The supply chain management strategies that prevailed before 2020 were focused on achieving cost efficiency. Firms scoured the globe for the cheapest suppliers, which in turn often resulted in widespread and complex supply chains that spanned national borders. Another goal was to keep inventories as lean as possible to minimise the cost of financing. This move towards supply chain complexity evolved over decades, motivated in part by the rise of Japanese manufacturers whose exports were considerably more competitive than those of their rivals. One key element of this competitive advantage was the practice of “just in time” inventory management, which subsequently became widespread. Concurrently, policymakers’ commitment to pursue a more globalised economy, including efforts to bring down tariffs and remove barriers to capital flows, contributed to vertical specialisation. This allowed firms and countries to concentrate on certain links in the supply chain. India, Vietnam to gain from supply chain shifts away from China This trend was reinforced by a reduction in underlying transport costs, as well as advances in information and communication technology. Firms were increasingly free to seek out the world’s cheapest suppliers. At the same time, this process tightened global interdependence, especially between East Asian economies and the rest of the world. These approaches were conditioned on the assumption that global links were reliable, predictable and cost-effective. However, the system’s vulnerabilities were highlighted by the pandemic and exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. As supply chain disruptions wove their way through the global economy, they forced companies and governments alike to rethink, reinvent and reinvest in their supply chains. One highly ambitious home-shoring test case is 2022’s US Chips and Science Act, which is providing some US$280 billion in new funding to bolster research and development and the United States’ domestic semiconductor industry. The legislation spurred the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest chip maker, to invest US$40 billion in two factories in Arizona, with the potential of greatly boosting the US’ ability to craft large volumes of semiconductors. Supply chain shifts have also resulted in investments outside the US. Notably, the technology supply chain has witnessed rising investment in areas outside China for several years now. Smartphone and tech hardware assembly has been highly concentrated in China, but suppliers are working to introduce new production capacity, especially in Mexico, India and Southeast Asia, where nations such as Vietnam and Thailand should see a rise in areas of manufacturing such as wearables, electronic components and batteries. India is also well positioned to benefit from the pattern of shifting supply chains. The focus has been on indigenisation as the government has taken significant steps to increase exports and rationalise imports. This could help India address some of its long-standing issues, such as manufacturing’s low share of GDP, which has been stuck around 15 per cent for the past decade. Additionally, the country is running a high current-account deficit. But India is projected to reach US$1 trillion in goods exports by 2028, representing a steep 17 per cent increase. In addition, New Delhi aims to increase manufacturing’s share of GDP to 25 per cent from the current 17.7 per cent by 2025. As part of that effort, it is addressing all its legacy bottlenecks linked to industrial production and is focusing on improving the ease of doing business. Mobile manufacturing is one of India’s success stories. It fell to insignificant levels after Nokia’s India manufacturing operations shut down in the mid-2010s, but the government took measures to revitalise the sector. It introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme and raised import duties on finished mobile phones. India then followed up with import duties on certain components to promote the “assembly, programming, testing and packaging” model of manufacturing. It enjoyed some success through this initiative, with the number of mobile phone manufacturing plants rising from just two in 2014 to 105 in 2019. Production increased from US$11 billion in 2017 to US$30 billion in 2021, while exports in that time frame rose from US$200 million to US$4 billion. Other schemes with a focus on increasing scale and added value followed. India introduced the Electronics Manufacturing Cluster and a scheme to promote programmes for the manufacturing of electronic components and semiconductors in 2020, which essentially offered capital expenditure subsidies. This was followed by the Production Linked Incentive scheme to encourage local production, allowing for 4 to 6 per cent incentives on incremental indigenous production. Reshoring, nearshoring and friend-shoring are undoubtedly in focus for the global economy, and opportunities are vast. However, supply chain rewiring is complex as it requires substantial investment and is likely to take years to bear fruit. Complexities flow from decisions made by firms about production, shipping and inventory management. Producing requires setting production plans, finding suppliers, locating workers and the decisions of millions of people about whether to enter the labour force and, if so, what job to take. Geopolitics, incentives and labour market dynamics are at play and will collectively conspire to define the real winners of this great reallocation.

140800553,Parents in France shop secondhand as back-to-school costs soar,"At the Emmaüs charity shop in Ivry-sur-Seine, on the south-east outskirts of Paris, a stick of glue sells for 50 centimes – a fraction of what you might pay in the supermarket. “It’s a real bargain to get supplies for cheap, especially with this crisis,” one mother told RFI as she browsed for stationery. “We can treat ourselves here. You can find almost everything they need for the year.” As children across France prepare to go back to class after the summer break, it’s up to parents to buy everything on the exhaustive list typically sent out by French schools before la rentrée, the annual September return. This year, the bill for the various pens, notebooks, sports kit and other supplies that pupils are expected to show up with is markedly steeper: 11.3 percent more than last year, according to household consumer association the Confédération Syndicale des Familles (CSF). The group estimates that the average cost of buying school supplies for a child in primary school is €233 in 2023, over €40 more than in 2022. Costs for pupils in middle and high school have also climbed to €371 and €427 respectively, though the rise is less steep. Other estimates have put the average price increase lower, at between 6 and 10 percent – but even at the low end it remains a bigger increase than in previous years, according to Emmanuel Fournet of consumer research company NielsenIQ, which studied school supply bills for FranceInfo. Inflation bites The chief factor is inflation, which has been running high in France for the past year, peaking at 6.3 percent in February. The impact is especially marked in the stationery aisle, since rising energy prices have had a knock-on effect on the cost of paper pulp. According to the CSF, stationery is around 25 percent more expensive this summer. Not at the Emmaüs in Ivry, which sells items donated to it. All last week it held a special sale on school supplies advertised as being “in excellent condition”. “The prices are very affordable,” shop manager Pepin Assi told RFI's Sylvie Koffi. As customers browsed, he explained: “Sometimes we lower the price on the tag, and sometimes we also give things away for free because we realised that there are parents who have lost their jobs ... So what do you do? We have to respond to that too.” Back-to-school benefits France provides financial support for families struggling to buy school supplies in the form of a back-to-school allowance (allocation de rentrée scolaire). Paid out to around 3 million low-income households each August, the allowance was increased by 5.6 percent this year compared to 2022 to account for inflation. It now ranges from €398 for the youngest schoolchildren to €435 for high-schoolers. The government also asked France’s biggest supermarket chains to limit price increases on school supplies as part of the anti-inflation deal it struck with retailers earlier this year to keep essential products affordable. French shoppers promised lower prices as retailers threatened with sanctions Nonetheless, in July the minister for trade, Olivia Grégoire, asked France’s consumer protection agency to look into the rising cost of school supplies. The findings will be delivered in September, she said, taking into account the promotions typically offered at the end of August. Education minister Gabriel Attal even suggested this week that the government would consider taking steps to make school supplies available to parents at wholesale prices. “We are going through a very tough period of inflation and school supplies aren’t something you can skimp on,” he told TF1 television. Donated supplies In the meantime, charitable organisations are stepping in to help fill school bags before the new term starts on 4 September. As well as Emmaüs, charities including Secours Populaire Français, Caritas and the Red Cross are encouraging those who can afford it to donate new or used school supplies to be sold cheaply – or given for free – to families in need. In the eastern city of Strasbourg, for example, Caritas and Secours Populaire say they distributed brand-new supplies to some 1,120 schoolchildren this month, asking only a nominal payment of €2 or less. The initiative is aimed at parents who don’t qualify for the government’s back-to-school allowance, typically because they’re still working their way through France’s asylum or immigration system. The number of children receiving help has nearly doubled this year, the charities say; last school year, it was 600. More French people turn to food banks as inflation bites But even above the poverty line, a growing number of people see the appeal of used supplies. According to a poll by online financial consultants Yomoni, 32 percent of nearly 1,000 parents surveyed this summer said they were planning to reuse school supplies, while 16 percent were buying secondhand. Meanwhile French classified ads website Leboncoin reports it has seen searches for folders, pencil cases, backpacks and other school items soar in recent weeks as parents hunt for used goods online. Back at the Emmaüs in Ivry, one father of three told RFI he comes to the charity shop every rentrée. “It saves us a bit of money,” he said as he looked for highlighter pens. “It can’t hurt what with inflation as it is. We start at Emmaüs, then whatever we can’t find we’ll look for in the supermarket.” He’s not bothered that his kids will be returning to school with some secondhand items in their pencil cases. “As long as it works,” he says. “Plus it’s environmentally friendly – we should be reusing things.”",https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20230902-parents-in-france-shop-secondhand-as-back-to-school-costs-soar,https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/0213ec3e-40fd-11ee-ba90-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000_F68YP.jpg,2023-09-02 13:18:45,Jessica Phelan,en,fr,-0.35000000000000003
140488501,5 Steps To Successfully Navigate Big Pharma’s New Supply Chain Emissions and Climate Reporting Requirements,"On July 20, 2023, AstraZeneca, GSK, Novo Nordisk, Merck, Roche, Sanofi and Samsung Biologics, seven of the world’s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, published an open letter to all of their suppliers with an urgent plea to become greener, more efficient, and circular. The manufacturers have joined with the World Health Organization (WHO) in a strategic effort to decarbonize the healthcare sector and move it toward net zero. What is different from each individual company’s previous corporate climate communications is the fact that they have joined together and broadened their collective goals to require reporting and commitments from their supply chains. The companies’ leaders have set joint, minimum climate and sustainability targets as well as definitive deadlines, beginning in 2025, to disclose emissions, climate and waste reductions, and science-based target goals. They are also requiring their suppliers to make commitments to switch to renewable power by 2030, to set climate and reporting standards for suppliers further upstream, and to set targets to increase water efficiency and establish comprehensive water stewardship practices. This is a LOT for suppliers to take in! Many, particularly small and privately owned companies, have never had to calculate their own Scope 1 and 2 emissions, consider their Scope 3 emissions (emissions from their own upstream and downstream supply chains), or address the setting of science-based targets for the future. This is a huge lift for any company, and embarking on a sustainable climate journey can seem like an insurmountable task, particularly with a reporting deadline in just two years. SCS has been helping companies navigate sustainability challenges for four decades and assists companies in making the transition toward robust climate and environmental objectives. We understand what it takes to start from scratch on a corporate climate strategy, the steps involved to achieve an initial corporate carbon footprint, and how to successfully present accurate data in a sustainability report that can be fully verified. We’ve worked with many global companies, large and small, to understand what is considered material within a particular industry and business type, what should be reported, and how to move where you are today towards setting achievable and meaningful targets based on science and fact instead of marketing spin and fiction. Whether you are in the Pharma supply chain or any other supply chain that is beginning to require emissions reporting, and regardless of the size of your company, below are our five recommendations for meeting the new emissions reporting requirements and setting a new standard for your ongoing corporate sustainability practices. 1. Offset Panic with a Plan Many companies may find themselves in a tailspin. That is understandable, but panic will not solve the problem. Planning will. Pull together your internal stakeholders, including members of your leadership team, operations, supply chain management, procurement, IT, accounting and others who are involved in any activities that utilize power (generation and usage), transportation, waste, emissions and recordkeeping. Unless you already have an experienced sustainability leader well-versed on greenhouse gas calculations, reporting and climate mitigation on your team, it is best to bring into your kick-off discussions an external climate consultant with experience in emissions calculations, science-based target setting, sustainability reporting, sustainable supply chains, and water stewardship practices. This will help you understand the breadth and scope of what you will be undertaking to meet the reporting and science-based target requirements, and support you in putting together a successful internal ESG Management System. For many companies, this will be a new approach to doing business that will require significant internal shifts to ensure successful entry into the circular economy. 2. Get Educated to Take Advantage of the Latest Climate Science Once your company has created an internal sustainability team focused on meeting your customers’ emissions and climate requirements, your team would benefit from learning about the range of factors contributing to climate change. Companies focused solely on carbon dioxide emission reductions could be missing a lot of low hanging fruit when it comes to establishing and meeting science-based targets with meaningful, short- and long-term climate impact. For instance, your team will be inspired to learn that methane mitigation has far more short-term climate benefit than most people recognize, and that reductions in nitrous oxide and other “long-lived” climate pollutants are also powerful ways to reduce impacts from your company and supply chain. Moreover, you can now get credit for reducing very “short-lived” climate pollutants, such as black carbon from combustion and tropospheric ozone, which have historically been left out of carbon footprinting. These potent climate pollutants are having a major impact on the earth’s excess trapped heat, which in turn is wreaking havoc on global and regional temperatures and increasingly dangerous weather-related events. This is not the climate science of a decade ago, and sustainability teams owe it to themselves to be fully educated so they can make informed decisions when reporting and setting achievable science-based targets. 3. Develop the Basics For suppliers new to emissions and sustainability reporting, the first place to start is with a Materiality Assessment. A materiality assessment, in essence, is a determination of the myriad ways in which your company operations, including your own supply chains, may be contributing to climate change as well as other environmental, social and economic impacts. The assessment will help you discover what to report based on your industry, how to collect quantitative and qualitative data, how to engage with stakeholders, and how to align with the different emissions reporting frameworks such as GRI, CDP, TCFD and others that might be required by the companies you supply. Of particular concern will be assessing the materiality of Scope 3 emissions, which fall into 15 categories including emissions from both your upstream and downstream value chain. In addition, you’ll want to calculate your company’s corporate carbon footprint or Greenhouse Gas Inventory and have your data independently verified to ensure that it is accurate increasing confidence in the data reported. Care should be taken to ensure that the data meet the supply chain requirements of your customers as well as the requirements of any regulatory requirements in the regions where you do business, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Directive (CSDR), California SB 253, and many of the proposed regulations in the U.S. and abroad. You’ll also want an inventory format that can be used year after year to ensure consistency in reporting. 4. Get Grounded in the Different Emissions Disclosure Frameworks There are many different emissions disclosure frameworks used in the market. For instance, if your company is a supplier to both pharmaceutical companies and other large entities such as retailers, you may find yourself needing to report the same data in different formats. When preparing a sustainability report, either for the first time or on an ongoing basis, keep in mind the changing reporting landscape and the requirements of each of your “requesters” (the companies and agencies requiring you to report your emissions data). AstraZeneca, for example, is requiring suppliers to report through CDP. Samsung Biologics is also a member of the CDP Supply Chain, enabling its suppliers to report directly through the CDP framework. Other frameworks such as TCFD and GRI may also be used by other pharma companies requiring supply chain reporting, and companies in multiple supply chains will need to be aware of the differences in reporting frameworks to ensure accuracy of reporting. For companies new to emissions reporting, working with a reputable sustainability consultancy can offer significant insights and support in understanding the nuances of sustainability reporting frameworks and ESG risk rating systems that all of the pharma companies are scrutinized under, such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), MSCI, Bloomberg ESG, DJSI, Sustainalytics, and others. Supplier reporting, which is considered part of the pharma companies’ Scope 3 emissions, will continue to have a growing impact on how pharma companies are rated. 5. Get Serious About Your Company’s Future Climate Impact Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting is simply the tip of the iceberg when it comes to shifting gears towards becoming a circular company. The pharma companies are requiring science-based target setting as a way to not only future-proof your company but also to detail how your company will facilitate becoming part of a low-carbon economy. These are well-defined and achievable targets for emissions reductions both internally and within your own supply chain leading to successful climate mitigation. Science-based target setting can also be an integral part of creating your own sustainable supply chain, another requirement set forth by the pharma companies. Integral to the lowering of emissions, both internally and externally, is the creation of new pathways for additional climate strategies that move beyond a solo focus on carbon emissions and dig deep into other forms of pollutants that negatively impact air, land and water. Many companies are implementing corporate zero waste strategies that address the reduction, recycling, and diversion from landfills of all forms of solid, liquid, and chemical waste. In tandem, water stewardship practices are considered by many, and in particular by the ESG risk rating organizations, to be “the next carbon” as the level of chemical and plastic pollution in our waterways continues to escalate and access to clean water diminishes throughout the world. While the pharma companies have extended an olive branch in these areas by moving requirements for implementing such programs back to 2030, now is the time to be adding these into your comprehensive sustainability strategy to ensure that your company and all its facilities are able to pivot to meet the requirements and achieve a lower carbon and pollution footprint. Regardless of your previous reporting requirements, whether full-on ESG reporting or none at all, the time has come for all companies that fall within the supply chains of large, publicly traded entities to realize that the new, green economy is upon us, and required reporting is quickly becoming the norm, not the exception. To be a part of this economy requires diligence, education, and support from others who are well versed on the regulations, reporting frameworks, and the science that’s driving a more climate-friendly way of business. We are here to help and work together with you towards building a greener, cleaner planet.

141794123,Farming: Red Meat Sector now worth £2.8 billion to the Scottish economy,"Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) has this week released an assessment of the vital economic contribution of Scotland’s red meat supply chain to the Scottish economy; the last time a similar assessment was undertaken was in 2016. Red meat production contributed between 36 per cent and 38 per cent of Scottish agricultural output in the latest five years for which figures are available, with almost a quarter of output coming from the iconic beef sector. Sarah Millar, QMS’s Chief Executive said: “This report is vital to understanding the red meat supply chain in Scotland’s total - as well as it’s rural economy. ""Red meat is fundamental to Scotland’s agri-food sector, with an annual economic output of an estimated £2.8bn, up over 16 per cent from £2.4bn in 2016.” The red meat supply chain is absolutely fundamental to wider Scottish agriculture. It includes on-farm production, farming inputs and processing. Whilst varying regionally, red meat output accounts for 36 per cent of national farming output, with on-farm output now up by more than £100m, from £1.16bn in 2016, to £1.27bn now. The wider supply chain also generates important revenues with £885m from meat processing, £361m from core supply trading (veterinary, machinery, fertiliser, feed and repairs/buildings) and a further £225m in output from other farm supplies. The report highlights the future value of maximising livestock output from Scotland: “There is opportunity to retain more value from the red meat chain if more Scottish livestock were processed in Scotland, but this requires the whole chain to work together to build the opportunities in a number of ways – as we outlined in QMS’s five-year strategy at this year’s Royal Highland Show. ""It’s vital that we all shout loud and proud about our meat’s provenance, quality, and the heritage of our Scotch red meat to develop an increase in domestic supply contracts as well as export opportunities, hand in hand with ensuring that there is sufficient abattoir capacity to process the increased throughput.” The report also gives a comprehensive update on the employment within the red meat chain, which currently sustains over 39,000 jobs, 80 per cent of which – 31,200 people - are on farm, 3880 in meat processing, 2000 in the core supplies industry – such as feed and veterinary services - and 2200 employed in other supplies to the sector. Ms Millar adds: ““Livestock farming is so important to the fabric of our rural economies, supporting both hired and family labour, in full-time and in part-time roles, and in-turn other local businesses in rural and remote places. “What’s also important to note is that, when you add in the further processing of red meat into cooked foods and food service, for example, the total employment contribution of the red meat sector is even greater.” Finally, the report highlights the importance of red meat-based agriculture to remote rural areas. Ms Millar says: “The farms and crofts that produce store lambs and cattle underpin economic activity in much of Scotland, and importantly, the hills and islands of the north and west. Without crofting and hill farms, there would be increased depopulation and the hollowing out of remote communities.” Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: “This report highlights the continued importance of the red meat supply chain both to Scotland’s economy as well as our rural communities. “Improvements in on-farm efficiency as well as work to further build the brand and reputation of our nation’s iconic meats have led to a marked increase in value of the sector. “This is down to the diligence and hard work of farmers, crofters and all those who work in the wider supply chain.” Do you want to respond to this article?

144960203,Thank you for subscribing!,"The joint venture partners behind the proposed Muir Mhòr floating offshore wind farm, located off the east coast of Scotland, have launched a supplier portal, potentially unlocking over £12m of domestic supply chain opportunities. Prospective suppliers, technical innovators, skills providers and development partners are being invited to engage with the project team via a new supplier registration page on the dedicated project website. The development marks a formalisation of the project’s commitment to a transparent and inclusive engagement with the supply chain from an early stage - with a key ambition being to stimulate growth within the domestic supply chain and realise local opportunities as far as possible. The joint venture partners, Fred. Olsen Seawind and Vattenfall, are also planning to run 'meet the buyer' events in the coming months. David Hinshelwood, project director for Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm, said: “ScotWind represents a major investment in Scotland’s green energy future, and it is key that this once-in-a-generation opportunity also stimulates sustainable growth of a world-class Scottish supply chain. “We are committed to exploring local opportunities and actively investigating what is feasible in Scotland, and have undertaken positive, early discussions with supply chain partners over the last 12 months. “The launch of our supply chain portal formalises this engagement and marks an important next step for the project - we look forward to meeting many potential suppliers at upcoming conferences and industry events, and encourage prospective suppliers, innovators and partners to contact us through the portal to realise opportunities.” Stephen Kennedy, procurement and commercial manager for the wind farm, added: “From the outset of the Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm project, we have actively investigated what supply chain opportunities are feasible in Scotland and explored local supplier options first. “This has seen us award over £3.87m to Scottish suppliers in development contracts, with further contracting opportunities, and unlock key STEM skills opportunities locally through Xodus’ X-Academy, UHI Future Leaders Fund and other community initiatives. “Whilst there are well-known capacity challenges in the domestic supply chain, market growth in the Scottish and UK offshore wind supply chain is hugely positive.” Don't miss the latest headlines with our twice-daily newsletter - sign up here for free.",https://www.insider.co.uk/news/floating-wind-farm-developer-launches-30968578,https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article25981699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS176500501-1.jpg,2023-09-18 14:36:50,Peter A Walker,en,gb,0.464
137636293,Logistics Interdiction for Taiwan Unification Campaigns,"If China attacks Taiwan, its ability to move the requisite levels of troops and supplies in a contested environment will be critical in determining its success. This makes logistics interdiction is an important, yet understudied, consideration. The good news for Western military planners is that whether the People’s Liberation Army launches a joint firepower strike campaign, a joint blockade campaign, or joint island landing campaign, its logistics capabilities would likely constitute a major weakness. This, at least, is the conclusion we drew from examining Chinese and Western military doctrine, studying similar historical campaigns, and conducting supply chain simulations. Joint Firepower Strike Campaign If Beijing launched a joint firepower strike campaign, its objective would be to apply stand-off, coercive pressure to force reunification. A strike campaign would employ conventional ground- and air-launched ballistic and cruise missiles ranging in intensity from limited strikes against symbolic targets to a broader approach aimed at paralyzing Taiwan’s political, military, and economic systems. A limited campaign might consist of employing People’s Liberation Army ballistic missile capabilities against a few salient objectives. A broader campaign would include a combination of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, artillery, and other stand-off ground strike capabilities. Targets would include air bases, command and control centers, energy infrastructure, air defense, and long-range strike capabilities. Chinese doctrinal texts highlight the importance of target selection and proper weapon employment to degrade the enemy’s will. Chinese strategists are likely aware of Western precedents like Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Linebacker in Vietnam and NATO’s successes in the Balkans. For a People’s Liberation Army joint firepower strike campaign to succeed, one of two things must happen: Either Taipei capitulates quickly or strikes are used for escalatory purposes, including softening resistance in preparation for a cross-strait invasion. In both scenarios, failure to achieve quick and decisive success risks providing Taiwan’s international allies with time to organize a military response, forcing the Chinese to fight on multiple fronts. Because this campaign deploys combat capability primarily within the borders of mainland China, opportunities for logistics interdiction are sparse and unlikely to make a meaningful impact. Given China’s robust domestic transportation network, Taiwan’s best approach to exploiting the People’s Liberation Army’s logistics weaknesses is simply to withstand the initial assault and stretch the campaign’s timelines. Taiwanese cruise and ballistic missiles could be directed at logistics capabilities near the shoreline and aggregated masses of troops and material to degrade the People’s Liberation Army offensive capabilities. However, this would have negligible effect in disrupting supply lines from inland China to support prepositioned coastal forces. While logistics interdiction in this option might have limited success, the Chinese army still faces considerable risk in sustaining its forces during a protracted campaign. Consider the vast difference in peacetime training and exercise flight hours between People’s Liberation Army Air Force pilots and comparable U.S. pilots. Chinese bomber pilots fly approximately 80 hours per year, with the rest of the training conducted in simulators. However, a joint firepower strike campaign calls for these pilots to fly approximately 60 hours every two weeks. The intensity of this campaign would result in a dramatic uptick in demand for aircraft spare parts, fuel, and munitions. The stochastic nature of part failures and difficulty of forecasting the behavior of breakages under combat conditions would result in a significant portion of the fleet being grounded for lack of parts. And munitions shortages would mirror those in other high-intensity conflicts should the campaign become protracted, making it reasonable to assume that expenditures would outpace resupply. In sum, a joint firepower strike campaign consisting of independent strikes on key targets is simple to plan and results in minimal risk during execution. On the other hand, this strategy would almost certainly be less effective than a blockade or invasion in securing Beijing’s political goals. Taiwanese and allied nations’ logistics interdiction options are limited, yet a lengthy conflict creates Chinese risk, as spare parts and munitions production likely would not keep up with demand. The ability of Taiwan’s military and civil institutions to simply survive and prolong the campaign could expose these vulnerabilities. Joint Blockade Campaign The objective of a joint blockade campaign would be to undermine the will and warfighting potential of Taiwan. It would apply the maximum possible pressure short of a full island landing and provide many options to escalate or de-escalate the conflict. This allows Chinese political leadership to ramp up coercive pressure to enhance their negotiating position, then either transition to a full island invasion should Taipei continue to resist or discontinue the blockade should their position become untenable. After a military build-up, a blockade would begin with full-spectrum offensive strikes on political, military, command and control, and logistics targets to achieve air, sea, and information superiority. Secondary targets would include antisubmarine forces, surface combatants, mine-clearing ships, and submarines. Offensive operations would conclude with the Chinese navy establishing sea dominance around Taiwan and its outer islands. Then the blockade would enter a sustainment phase involving continuous lockdown of Taiwan’s air and sea lines of communication. In addition to the maritime blockade, Chinese land- and carrier-based aviation forces would provide fighter combat air coverage and the Chinese coast guard would lead in conducting maritime board, search, and seizure operations. In assessing the logistics implications for a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, the U.S. blockade of Cuba in 1962 offers a useful point of comparison. A similar campaign would see the Chinese navy establish a blockade ring 50 miles from the Taiwanese shore and approximately 1,000 miles in length. Taiwan is geographically smaller than Cuba and Chinese military technology is far more advanced than that employed by the United States in 1962. However, the objective of total blockade would require a substantial Chinese fleet that would impose significant logistical demands. Still, as with the U.S. blockade of Cuba, China’s ability to mobilize and leverage its vast organic supply reserves, combined with access to the logistics resources of neighboring friendly nations (Russia, North Korea), would likely preclude any major short-term supply deficits. This analysis presumes that Taiwan fails to mount a vigorous defense and allied navies remain uninvolved. However, if Taiwan perceives the blockade as an existential threat, the campaign would take on a kinetic nature resulting in significant attrition. While the food, fuel, munitions, and spare parts required to sustain blockade forces would still flow eastward with relative ease, Taiwanese targeting of Chinese seaports would disrupt ports of debarkation and limit the ability to refuel and repair ships. Taiwanese mining of critical sea routes, combined with strikes on inland strategic petroleum reserves, munitions depots, and maintenance facilities, would degrade the Chinese navy’s ability to sustain their forces in the medium-to-long term. However, Taiwan’s actions would have to be carefully calculated, as their strikes may have negligible effects in the short term and carry substantial escalatory risks. Overall, a joint blockade campaign would apply a great amount of pressure on Taiwanese military and economic institutions. But compared to a protracted joint firepower strike campaign, it creates an even more significant risk should Taiwan fail to capitulate quickly. From a logistics point of view, the People’s Liberation Army would be forced to consider some of the same inherent risks, namely potential shortages of munitions, critical spare parts, and fuel. Joint Island Landing Campaign The joint island landing campaign is the riskiest, but the one that delivers the greatest coercive pressure. After several months of mobilization and prepositioning, initial operations would attempt to quickly achieve air, maritime, and information superiority by targeting air/maritime bases, command and communication nodes, and air defenses. Major seaports and airfields would be early targets for capture to facilitate follow-on reinforcements and supplies. If the People’s Liberation Army successfully gained a foothold on the island, it could present the United States and its allies with a difficult-to-reverse fait accompli. By seizing the initiative, China could limit potential options for foreign military intervention. Despite some important distinctions, a useful comparison for China’s logistical challenges would be Operation Overlord. The Allies confronted an extended German army, fighting well outside their own territory and thinly spread along the French coastline. In contrast, Taiwan would be defending a much more concentrated territory, and its defenses would be more condensed, overlapping, and robust. There is no retreat for Taiwanese forces, only surrender, so they are likely to resist fiercely. Also, the Allies quickly secured complete air and sea superiority, which is far from guaranteed in a Taiwan conflict. Movement of forces across the Taiwan Strait (mostly by sea) would incur high rates of attrition. Military maritime transportation capacity is heavily reliant on the mobilization of civilian resources during times of war, and China actively promotes the production of civilian roll-on/roll-off ships to support military-specific requirements. This would allow People’s Liberation Army planners the necessary maritime capacity to move an invasion army. However, not all ships are built to military specifications and their use would impact civilian activities, adversely affecting China’s economy and trade. As most forces and logistics support will be shipborne, Chinese and Taiwanese ports represent potential bottlenecks. A cross-strait invasion would require significant buildup of forces and logistics, and Taiwanese intelligence would have ample time to build a stratified target list. Should an invasion appear imminent, heavy mining and deliberate sabotage of Taiwan’s own airport and seaport capabilities could worsen Beijing’s challenge, while Chinese ships waiting offshore to unload their cargo would be particularly vulnerable to Taiwanese fires. Even if the People’s Liberation Army could establish and hold a beachhead, subsequent transportation of troops and supplies would be challenging. Rail networks are available but would be risky, as they are susceptible to sabotage and difficult to maintain and repair. The two main Taiwanese roadways run parallel to the coasts and are ideal for serving coastal cities, but not for the movement of forces across the island. Roadways across the island are consolidated into a small number of main arteries that are easily interdicted. If Taiwanese forces continues to field an organized military resistance, they would have numerous opportunities to disrupt People’s Liberation Army movement by exploiting natural bottlenecks such as bridges and mountain passes. A joint island landing campaign is the most decisive approach to achieving Taiwanese reunification, but the complexity of such an operation, combined with the political, economic, and military implications of failure, make this an extremely risky gambit. Logistically, the People’s Liberation Army is not constrained by transportation capacity in moving troops and supplies across the strait. The success or failure of the campaign would also be apparent in a few weeks, thus removing many potential sustainment issues. Yet, it is in this campaign that the strongest risk of logistics interdiction exists. From air and seaports of debarkation in mainland China to difficult shore landings in Taiwan and congested or unpassable ground lines of communication on the island, there are an almost innumerable number of potential bottlenecks that could grind Chinese logistics support to a standstill. Campaign failure would be a national disgrace with possibly existential implications for the ruling party. Conclusions Looking at the role of logistics interdiction in potential Chinese military operations has important implications for Taiwan’s defense. In the first two scenarios discussed here, the People’s Liberation Army would have difficulty sustaining operations should they turn into protracted campaigns. But they would face fewer logistics interdiction risks, making these options less risky overall. However, these campaign options are unlikely to achieve the sort of quick capitulation desired by Chinese political leadership and may significantly undermine China’s international standing. By contrast, the last campaign option is the least likely to result in a protracted campaign (thus avoiding sustainment problems), yet carries serious logistics interdiction risks. In the first two campaign options, Taiwan should focus on delaying Chinese offensive operations and surviving long enough for inherent Chinese supply chain problems to emerge, and for its allies to organize a response to force a political settlement. If facing a joint island landing campaign, Taiwan should employ an active defense, rapidly and decisively exploiting Chinese logistics vulnerabilities. If this happens, and Taiwanese resistance does not crumble, the Chinese invasion could face acute supply difficulties, or even campaign failure, in a matter of weeks, if not days.

140192033,Gold Fields spends $896m in 2022 on procurement,"Gold Fields Ghana Limited spent $896 mil-lion in 2022 to procure goods and services for its operations with more than 90 per cent of the amount going to local Ghanaian suppliers, the Vice President and Head of Finance, Gold Fields West Africa, Lindley Hassler Witbool, has stated. He, therefore entreated the 1,600 active Ghanaian suppliers and other business partners to de-liver quality products and services crucial to its mining operations in the country. “With such a large number of suppliers and enormous pro-curement budget, it is in order to gather all of our business partners, once in a while, to deliberate on is-sues of mutual concern,” Mr Wit-bool told participants at a two-day supply chain conference at Tarkwa Mine in the Western Region. “It is to also share ideas and best practices to navigate global supply chain challenges that direct-ly impact our businesses, learn new trends to improve our business processes,” Mr Witbool added. It was on the theme “The Envi-ronment, Social and Governance (ESG) culture change: An imper-ative to building a resilient supply chain through partnership”. The suppliers will discuss supply chain challenges, procurement, energy and decarbonisation, the people factor, female empower-ment, gender framework to sup-port female owned businesses and an effective emergency evacuation drill. He said that 2019 conference provided constructive feedback and ideas from our suppliers and had restructured and improved procurement, tender and payment procedures, to ease the process and eliminate bottlenecks over the few years, hence the theme for the 2023 one. He said the supply chain strate-gy supported the development of local businesses through capac-ity-building strategic incubation including prompt and hassle-free payment for goods and services supplied. Moreover, Mr Witbool said implemented preferential pay-ment terms for licensed small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) that had established offices in host communities. This, he explained that host community SMEs who supplied to the company would receive pay-ment within 10 to 15 days, once they submitted a valid invoice. In line with ESG issues, Mr Witbool said the company was discussing how to deal with busi-nesses owned and led by women, particularly on gender diversity, “which charges us to increase women representation in our workforce to 30 per cent by 2030.” This policy, he said, went be-yond employing more women to incubating and empowering female entrepreneurs, business owners and leaders. “We do not intend to unduly prioritise female-owned and led businesses to the detriment of other companies. Once you meet the tender requirements for a job, we will ensure fairness in award-ing these contracts,” Mr Witbool stressed. He said helping businesses to grow fell under Gold Fields ESG priority 6, which is stakeholder value creation, mandating the com-pany to create and share the value of gold with all our stakeholders, including business partners. He added “As such, our goal is to carry you all along as we explore various opportunities to sustain our mining operations for the long-term benefit of all stakehold-ers. “You must learn about our sup-ply chain procedures, understand the requirements for engaging in tender, be aware of our expecta-tions --be sure to follow them--to benefit from the various business opportunities available at Gold Fields,” he said. Head of Supply Chain, Gold Fields, Theophilus Otchere, de-scribed the conference as import-ant because “globally, supply chain is what is getting us moving.” FROM CLEMENT ADZEIBOYE, TARKWA",https://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/gold-fields-spends-896m-in-2022-on-procurement/,https://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GOLD-FIELDS-CONFAB-Mr-Witbool-inset-addressing-the-participants.jpg,2023-08-31 10:15:31,GTonline,en,gh,0.068
143546369,Times of Zambia,"THERE has always been a belief that the mining sector can offer more in terms of contribution to the local economy that it is currently doing.This is through stronger participation of local people in the mining value chain to get more economic benefits beyond jobs and tax revenues.Drawing more local suppliers on stream will require improved capacity, enabling business and financial capacity to meet the high-quality product and service specifications.It is not a secret that most local suppliers of goods and services to the mines fall short of quality specifications because of a number of reasons.Among them are the limited value addition, the limited technical capacity, access to affordable financing to be able to produce competitive goods and services and the perceived foreign cartels.In addition, experts blame lack of effective local content policies to international protocols that view local content laws as discriminatory.Available data indicates that of the US$4 billion annual mining expenditure in Zambia, only less than 13 percent of that is procured from local enterprises.But the Government and stakeholders in the mining value chain have been pushing for a local content law to boost the local participation in the mining value chain.During the 2023 Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) Mining LocalContent Conference, Mines and Mineral Development Minister PaulKabuswe stated that a local law is in offing.In a speech read for him by Ministry’s assistant director CanisiusMwenya, MrKabuswesaid to uplift the livelihoods of the Zambian people, thenarrative needed to change by strengthening the backward-forwardlinkages of the sector with other key economic sectors.These are sectors such asmanufacturing to achieve economic transformation and diversificationas we aim to increase exports of value-added goods.As for ZAM vice-president FronscenHaloba, a strong mining localcontent policy is critical in growing the participation of local people inthe mining value chain.As ZAM advocates for the preparedness of local actors to meet the demands of mining firms, Ms Haloba says there is need to bear in mind that the mining industry is highly specialised.“We need to be cognisant about the specialised nature of goods andservices required in mining value chains, the inputs the industryrequires are often at the higher end of the technology spectrum,” MsHaloba says.But she has a word for the mining industry.MsHaloba says procuring from local suppliers and manufacturers will mean fewer logistical and import costs as it is cheaper to sourceinputs closer to operations.Added to this is a significantly improved corporate image from communities surrounding operations.During the Kitwe gathering, Trade Policy Training Centre in Africa (TRAPCA) lecturer TsotetsiMakong cautioned policymakers in Zambia and elsewhere to align their local content policies with international trade and investment protocols.“I know governments in Africa are facing pressure from citizens especially in commodity countries to come up with local content policies that support local procurement of goods and services but there is need to be wary of the protocols governments sign,” he says.To him, countries should ensure that the local content policies do not contradict international protocols.MrMakong says there is also need to increase the country’s productive capacity that can substitute imports.Indeed for local content to work, there is need to invest in the production of competitive goods and services to reclaim the position.Prof Makong says there lies a need to take a scientific approach framing local policies to look at what could work and what could not work.The other challenge is limited access to cheaperfinancing by local manufacturers and suppliers which is rendering thelocal ‘cohort’ uncompetitive.“Imagine you find that for a particular company to supply the mines, they need to import the input to produce goods to supply the mine, ifthe cost of inputs is too high then the mine will prefer importingfinished products because locally produced would be too expensive,”Prof Makong says.To be competitive, local manufacturers need to invest in research and development as well as in technical capacity.To this end, the ZAM and the Copperbelt University (CBU) have signed a letter of intent to bridge the gap between the academia and the industry during the conference.Speaking during the signing ceremony, acting CBU vice-chancellor, Paul Chisale said thepartnership holds the potential to transform not only the academiclandscape of CBU but also the industrial as well as economic future ofZambia.“The partnerships between academia and industry have become essential in driving innovation, fostering economic growth, and addressing the challenges of our time,” Professor Chisale says.He says in a speech read for him by CBU Africa Centre of Excellencefor Sustainable Mining leader MwansaChabala that the collaboration signifies the acknowledgment of the interdependence between academia and industry.“It underscores the importance of research and education that is not just theoretical but practical, education that is closely aligned with the needs and challenges of the real world,” Prof Chisale says.MsHaloba describes the intent to collaborate signing between ZAM and CBU as a momentous event that has added greater importance to the conference.“As ZAM, we do recognise that enhancing local content in the mining sector needs concerted efforts from all stakeholders,” she says.MsHaloba says CBU, through its Africa Centre of Excellence in Sustainable Mining, which is known for ground-breaking research in mining, stands as a right collaborator to increase local content.Through the intent to collaborate, MsHaloba says ZAM hopes to work on more research which contributes to the local content.Under the partnership, CBU will provide access to its vast academic resources, research facilities, and a pool of talented students and faculty members.In return, ZAM will offer industry insights, real-world challenges,and opportunities for internships and research collaboration.The exchange will bridge the gap between theory and practice, by ensuring that graduates are better prepared for the workforce.Stakeholders should continue pushing for more interventions to expandthe participation of local suppliers of goods and services in the mineral value chain.",https://www.times.co.zm/?p=127610,https://www.times.co.zm/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kennedy-Mupeseni-1.jpg,2023-09-13 07:10:48,Times Reporter,en,zm,-0.032
140482877,Aramark Hits New Milestones and Sets New Targets To Help People and the Planet,"Be Well. Do Well.—Aramark’s Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) platform—encompasses the company’s focus on and commitment to helping people and the planet. “I am proud of the progress we are making to reduce inequity, support and grow communities, promote diversity, and protect our planet while strengthening the long-term value proposition of our business,” said John Zillmer, Chief Executive Officer, Aramark. At the end of fiscal year 2022, Aramark summarized the progress made delivering on the company’s ESG commitments. View 2022 Progress Report. Because work continues throughout the year, it is timely to share recent highlights and accomplishments that benefit people and the planet. Accelerating Environmental Sustainability From food purchases and operations to supplier selection and sourcing decisions, Aramark is committed to promoting planetary health. Aramark achieved a key milestone in the journey toward net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in July 2023 with the official approval of new global near- and long-term science-based targets to reduce the company’s carbon footprint. These enterprise-wide targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the global standard for corporate net-zero target setting. The approved targets include: Reducing direct emissions from the company’s operations including corporate offices and fleet by more than 50% by 2030;Substantially reducing indirect emissions by 2030, including engaging suppliers and reducing emissions from operations at client sites; andAchieving net-zero value chain emissions by 2050, including an absolute emissions reduction of 90%. Reducing emissions from food is key to achieving Aramark’s climate commitments. Therefore, the company has also committed to reducing food emissions 25% by 2030 through the Coolfood Pledge, and now serves Coolfood meals certified as low carbon at client locations across the U.S. and Canada. To minimize food waste, Aramark team members focus on prevention, recovery, and recycling during planning, purchasing, production, service, and post-service—in addition to training chefs and other operators on operating procedures and making choices that will help reduce food waste. In addition to other industry collaborations, this year Aramark committed to the Pacific Coast Food Waste Commitment (PCFWC) goal of reducing food waste by 50% along the west coast of the U.S. by 2030. As part of this commitment, Aramark has partnered with the PCFWC and other food service companies to pilot plate waste studies to support a better understanding of the drivers of post-consumer food waste and how consumer messaging may help influence food waste. A refreshed priority to embed circularity reaffirms Aramark’s commitment to eliminate or substantially reduce the company’s reliance on single-use plastics and other disposables, promote responsible consumption, and integrate reuse across operations. Partnering across the value chain is a critical component to achieving this commitment and Aramark actively engages suppliers, national brands, and NGOs in this effort. Through our membership in the Ocean Plastics Leadership Network, the company has had meaningful dialogue to begin participating in their Reuse and Refill Action Network. Valuing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) A commitment to DEI helps Aramark create an equal and inclusive culture vital to meeting the needs of the company’s employees, customers, and communities. In February 2023, Aramark announced a partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, the nation’s largest organization exclusively representing the Black College Community, to launch the Aramark HBCU Emerging Leaders Program. Fifteen students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) were chosen to attend a two-day immersive experience at Aramark’s headquarters in Philadelphia to focus on career exploration and professional development. The company’s 11 employee resource groups (ERGs) have focused on new membership growth, recruitment, professional development, community outreach, and global expansion. Year to date, our ERGs have experienced an approximate 20% increase in new membership, established new hubs in Latin America, Germany, UK, and Canada, and supported community outreach events that have impacted thousands of students across the country. This year, Aramark expanded its Pronouns Matter campaign companywide to educate employees on inclusive language and its importance in gender identity and expression. To date, more than 2,000 employees have used the resources. In June, Aramark launched its first campaign to encourage all employees to voluntarily and confidentially self-identify in the company’s human resources systems. The myWholeSelf self-ID campaign goals include helping the company better understand its LGBTQ+ population, inform DEI strategy, and continue to measure veterans and employees with disabilities in the company workforce. Building Vibrant Communities In April, Aramark celebrated its 10th annual global day of service, Aramark Building Community Day (ABC Day). ABC Day engages thousands of employee volunteers who dedicate their time, energy, and expertise to service projects in their local neighborhoods. This year, more than 5,000 Aramark volunteers from 12 countries participated in projects to support 130 nonprofit organizations, positively supporting nearly 150,000 community members. Read more about the 2023 ABC Day activities and impact. In recognition of the 10th annual ABC Day, 10 randomly selected nonprofit community organizations received one-time grants, thanks to nominations from the company’s most engaged employee volunteers. Sourcing Responsibly, Ethically, and Inclusively Aramark has a long-standing commitment to global procurement practices that strive to positively impact people, animals, and the environment. The company’s Responsible Sourcing program focuses on adopting environmentally sustainable, ethical, and inclusive sourcing practices throughout the supply chain—practices that benefit local and global economies, the communities we serve, and the planet. The following 2023 highlights further support this commitment to sourcing responsibly, ethically, and inclusively. With Aramark’s support, The FruitGuys Community Fund (TFGCF) makes multi-year grants to small and medium farms and agricultural non-profits. During the 2022 and 2023 grant cycles, the Aramark partnership has enabled TFGCF to award grants to 20 farms across 13 states, many of which are operated by beginning and under-represented farmers including women and/or Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). An enhanced Tier 2 supplier diversity portal was launched in 2023. Recruiting is underway for the fourth cohort of the Aramark and Chicago Minority Supplier Development Council’s Progress Insight Performance Education (PIPE) program. This eight-week, advanced management training program provides participants with the skills and knowledge needed to optimize their businesses. Aramark expanded its supplier sustainability assessment program with EcoVadis® to increase the number of priority category suppliers participating globally. As of June 2023, Aramark Spain was the first business to activate the program outside of North America. To grow food that’s nutritious and better for the planet, Aramark partnered with Babylon Micro-Farms. As of the end of July 2023, the 49 micro-farms, which supply fresh produce to Aramark client locations, have resulted in a reduction in water use, food waste, and nitrogen in waterways. Additionally, the company continues to make progress toward its sustainable sourcing commitments, including: Sourcing 100% contracted canned tuna that meets Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch recommendations.100% of the soy in contracted oils, margarines, and shortenings is from regions with no deforestation risk.100% of the palm oil in contracted margarines and shortenings is Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified.Ongoing monitoring, supplier engagement, and accelerating progress on Aramark’s animal welfare commitments, including pork welfare and cage free eggs globally; and In May, Aramark first reported efforts toward the ethical sourcing of broiler chickens in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, receiving favorable recognition from Compassion in World Farming organization.Received an A Grade in Mercy for Animals’ Count Your Chickens Report for progress toward better animal welfare.Read more about the company’s animal welfare commitments and other Aramark Responsible Sourcing Progress and Priorities. Notable Awards In August, Aramark was named one of the ""Best Companies for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)” by BLACK ENTERPRISE, the top Black digital media brand and premier business and financial resource for African Americans. This recognition highlights a select group of publicly traded corporations that have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to creating dynamic workforces, diverse corporate governance, expansive supply chains, and inclusive management. In July, Aramark earned a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index® (DEI), a joint initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and Disability:IN. With this top score, Aramark has been recognized as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the seventh consecutive year. Aramark was recognized as one of the most community-minded employers in the Greater Philadelphia region in June 2023. In the Civic 50, as the award is known, the company was ranked number one among companies over 500 employees for engaging employees, purchasing and supply chain, and promoting a more diverse and inclusive company culture. In May, Aramark was ranked number 40 on DiversityInc’s 2023 Top 50 Companies for Diversity list, up five spots from last year’s ranking. This is the seventh consecutive year Aramark appeared on the Top 50. For the first time, the company was also ranked on the Top Companies for Supplier Diversity at number 20. The company was named the Greenest Food Contractor in North America at the 2023 Green Restaurant Association Awards in April. The prestigious Green Restaurant Awards commend the restaurants and organizations in the restaurant industry which have accomplished a high level of environmental achievement in their respective categories. For the ninth consecutive year, Aramark was named a Top 50 Employer by CAREERS & the disABLED Magazine for providing a positive working environment for people with disabilities. In January 2023, Aramark was named to Newsweek’s 2023 list of America’s Most Responsible Companies.",https://kalkinemedia.com/news/world-news/aramark-hits-new-milestones-and-sets-new-targets-to-help-people-and-the-planet,https://kalkinemedia.com/storage/uploads/large/1667303166_636106feec962_banner.png,2023-09-01 11:59:56,3BL Media,en,au,0.294
142085767,5 Best Retail Stocks To Buy During Back-To-School Season - WorldNewsEra,"Back-to-school shopping is fun for students—but investors get a piece of the action, too. While the kids are stocking up on fresh spiral notebooks, investors can capitalize on revenue and profits earned in the second-biggest shopping season of the year. Read on to find out the latest predictions on back-to-school spending, plus five stocks to watch as families hit the stores for school supplies, apparel and technology. Back-To-School Trends Last year, families spent $36.9 billion on back-to-school shopping and $74 billion on back-to-college spending, according to the National Retail Federation (NFR). Relative to 2021, the back-to-school spend dipped by $200 million while back-to-college sales volume rose by $3 billion. For 2023, NFR expects strong spending growth for all student categories this year, from elementary school kids to those who are college-bound. Total projected spending on school-related items is $41.5 billion, while pre-college purchases are expected to reach $94 billion. That breaks down to $890.07 per family with school-age children and $1,366.95 per incoming college student. NFR expects the increase to be driven by greater demand for computers and related accessories. Some 69% of shoppers intend to buy electronics this year, up from 65% last year. NFR’s outlook equates to a spending increase of about 13% over the prior year. That’s more than four times the July 2023 inflation rate of 3.2%. A spending boost that outpaces inflation bodes well for ecommerce retailers, department stores and discount stores. These are the three retailer categories that back-to-school shoppers prefer, according to NFR. NFR’s back-to-school outlook comes from the organization’s annual survey. This year, 7,843 consumers participated. Mispriced stocks are hiding in plain sight and present great investment opportunities for the remainder of 2023. Forbes’ top investment experts share 7 overlooked stocks in this exclusive report, 7 Best Stocks To Buy For The Second Half of 2023. Click here to download it now. A Less Optimistic Outlook A smaller survey by Deloitte reveals a less optimistic outlook, however. Deloitte surveyed 1,212 parents of school-age children in May. At that time, parents said they’d planned to spend 10% less on back-to-school purchases in 2023. Those shoppers intended to use their inflation-constrained budgets primarily for school supplies—while limiting clothing and technology buys. What does this mean for investors? Back-to-school shoppers are dealing with higher prices, an uncertain economy and historically high interest rates. Exactly how much they’ll spend will reveal itself, but shoppers are likely to seek out deals in the form of lower prices and cashback rewards. In that scenario, low-price leaders and, possibly, credit card companies stand to benefit. 5 Retail Stocks To Watching During Back-To-School Season What are the best stocks to buy now? Below are five stocks that should capitalize on back-to-school deal hunters. Three of them are pure retail stocks, one is a tech/services/retail hybrid and the last is a tech/financial hybrid that benefits from higher retail sales. You may also like our coverage of best EV stocks and best industrial stocks for 2023. Note that the key metrics bulleted below are from Morningstar. Walmart Walmart key metrics: Trailing 12-month diluted EPS: $4.15 Net income three-year growth: -7.8% P/E ratio: 30.5 Debt/equity: 0.77 Forward dividend yield: 1.5% Walmart earns a spot on this list for the speed and strength of its back-to-school (BTS) campaigns. The mass retailer began BTS promotions in July, advertising classroom supplies and backpacks at 2022 prices. The store also carries clothes, electronics and dorm-room necessities, making it a one-stop shop for back-to-school and back-to-college shopping. This, combined with Walmart’s price-leader reputation, will drive families through the door. The company may also see gains in its Sam’s Club chain from shoppers looking for the lowest prices on tech and apparel. Walmart’s second quarter 2024 earnings release included a fiscal year 2024 sales growth guidance of 4% to 4.5%. The company’s consolidated operating income growth guidance is 7% to 7.5%. The consensus price target on Walmart is $176.35, which represents an upside of about 10.5%. Analysts from Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Truist Financial and UBS Group raised their price targets for the retailer in August 2023. Five Below Five Below key metrics: Trailing 12-month diluted EPS: $4.77 Net Income 3-year growth: 14.3% P/E ratio: 37.6 Debt/equity: 0.94 Forward dividend yield: NA Five Below specializes in novelty accessories, clothes, craft and school supplies and tech accessories—with many items priced $5 or less. Consider this store a cooler version of a dollar store that caters to tweens and teenagers. Five Below stores are commonly found in outdoor malls, surrounded by popular stores like Target and Ulta Beauty. Relative to dollar stores, which are often situated in less central locations, FIVE is an easy shopping destination for families in search of bargains. FIVE’s P/E ratio is higher than Walmart’s, but the chain has a solid track record of sales and earnings growth. The company’s most recent earnings release included a fiscal year 2023 comparable sales growth guidance of 1% to 3%. The net income guidance for the year is $297 million to $319 million. Net income in the prior year was $261.5 million. The consensus price target on FIVE is $215.36, which implies 17.75% upside.

Amazon Amazon key metrics: Trailing 12-month diluted EPS: $1.26 Net income 3-year growth: NA P/E ratio: 105.7 Debt/equity: 0.82 Forward dividend yield: NA Amazon is the leading online ecommerce destination. It’s also a place people shop when their local stores have empty shelves or in-store prices seem too high. As well, many parents of college kids default to Amazon as the easiest way to send supplies to students who’ve just moved away from home. For those reasons, Amazon is sure to win a piece of BTS spend. With its high P/E ratio, Amazon is obviously no value play. But the e-tailer and tech company does know how to grow its topline sales (even if net income can be inconsistent). Amazon expects third quarter 2023 sales to grow 9% to 13% year over year. That guidance includes a favorable foreign exchange impact. The e-tailer’s third quarter operating income guidance is $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion, which would double or triple the prior year’s result of $2.5 billion. Analysts see nearly 20% upside in Amazon stock, based on the consensus price target of $160.87. Costco Costco key metrics: Trailing 12-month diluted EPS: $13.50 Net income 3-year growth: 16.9% P/E ratio: 39.7 Debt/equity: 0.38 Forward dividend yield: 0.8% Costco is another popular source for discounts on clothes, tech and school supplies. The club is also promoting memberships for college students, so it can capitalize on $1.50 hot dogs and other bargains while they’re away from home. Costco’s dividend is weak relative to Walmart’s, but there is a strategy in play. Costco is committed to expanding its footprint and gaining market share—objectives that historically have served the company well. That leaves less cash for shareholders in the short term, but sets Costco up for continued, long-term growth. Costco doesn’t provide guidance, but analysts expect the club store chain to grow sales 6.1% and generate EPS of $14.06 in fiscal year 2023. Costco’s fiscal year ends in August. The consensus price target for Costco is $562.67, which equates to 3.7% upside. Visa Visa key metrics: Trailing 12 month diluted EPS: $4.15 Net income 3-year growth: 7.4% P/E Ratio: 30.9 Debt/Equity: 0.53 Forward Dividend Yield: 0.8% Visa makes more when payment volume across its platform increases—no matter what’s prompting the increase. So greater spending, higher prices, an ongoing shift to cashless payments and shoppers looking to leverage cash rewards on their credit card are all good trends for this high-margin payment processor.

139418599,"Mazda accelerates EV shift in China, reshaping ties with suppliers","Immediately after taking the helm of Mazda Motor, newly appointed President Masahiro Moro, who took office on June 27 in the first leadership change in five years, flew to China. “We are finally going to start full-scale operations here,"" he wrote in an email sent to people involved, determined to turn around sluggish China sales as his first mission as president. Mazda’s sales in China in the year from April 2022 had halved from the previous year to 84,000 units. The main reason was a thin lineup of electric vehicles popular in China, with the CX-30, launched in the autumn of 2021, being the only EV model for the Chinese market. While other companies launched new models one after another, Mazda sold only about 200 units of the CX-30 in fiscal 2022, which ended in March this year. Targeting a 50% increase In fiscal 2023, the company aims to achieve a 50% increase in sales in China. Although a new EV model, which Mazda sees as its ""main product,"" will not arrive in time, the company is pinning its hopes on the CX-50 hybrid vehicle set to be put on sale in the fall. With the sport utility vehicle, which was originally planned for the North American market, the company aims to attract customers looking for cars for outdoor activities. For carmakers, electrification is now a prerequisite for complying with environmental regulations in various countries. In China, in particular, sales of EVs and other environmentally friendly vehicles account for a quarter of all new vehicles sold. The Chinese government's generous support for EVs, including subsidies and tax breaks, has led to their rapid sales expansion and fierce price competition. “China is going straight into electrification,” Moro said, with a sense of crisis. “Some customers are coming into dealerships only to buy EVs."" Mazda will introduce new electric models to the Chinese market, including fully electric and hybrid vehicles, every year from fiscal 2024. China has been the world's largest market in terms of new vehicle sales for 14 consecutive years. Mazda plans to accelerate its shift to electrification through joint ventures with local companies in order to ""capture the revenues it had failed to generate,” a company official said. In markets other than China, however, Mazda is not necessarily rushing to electrify its vehicles. The European Union, which had tried to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, has made it possible to continue selling the vehicles on the condition that synthetic fuels are used. In the United States, policy directions differ from state to state. Being ‘a follower’ “We will not be the front-runner in EVs, but rather a willing follower until 2030,” Moro says. While making profits with its existing models — especially its large SUVs — the company will spend time on developing technologies for batteries and powertrains. Mazda plans to launch EVs on a full-scale globally from 2028. There is already demand for EVs made by the company. Tomohiro Hatanaka, general manager of the new car sales division at Mazda dealer Enfini Hiroshima, said, ""Some companies only use electric and hybrid vehicles as company cars.” Expectations for EVs will likely grow also among individual customers looking for Mazda’s “fun to drive” features. Moro says environmental responsiveness is a prerequisite as a carmaker, while the firm's mission to deliver a “joy of driving” must also remain intact in the future. EVs have the potential to deliver on both of those goals. As long as Mazda is committed to being a ""follower,"" it is expected to demonstrate its uniqueness in vehicles’ performance and ride quality, and offer values that surpass those of its rivals. ""We will mass-produce the excitement of the mobile experience,” Moro said. Parts suppliers Toshio Uno, an executive at auto parts manufacturer Hirotec, says the company must take on the challenge of developing EV parts even if it’s costly. Since last August, Hirotec has been developing production technology for EV powertrains at a joint venture with fellow parts-makers Hiroshima Aluminum Industry and Ondo, along with Mazda. EV powertrain components include electric motors and electronic control units, and EVs don't need the mufflers Hirotec manufactures. While a gasoline-powered car is said to have about 30,000 parts, an EV needs about 20,000, which means that electrification could change not only the structure of cars but also the automotive industry as a whole. Mazda estimates that in the Chugoku region there are about 10,000 workers involved in the production of internal combustion engines, including those who work at parts suppliers. ""In order to maintain the industry and employment, the entire supply chain, including our business partners, must change its business models,” said Ichiro Hirose, Mazda's director and senior managing executive officer. The establishment of the joint venture with local parts manufacturers is the first step in such efforts. Mazda will invest ¥1.5 trillion in its shift to electrification by 2030, including through collaborations with its business partners. Money will be spent on a wide range of research and development, including that for EV motors and batteries, but there is no guarantee that all suppliers will be involved. Some component-makers are already facing headwinds. A top executive of a local parts manufacturer complained, ""If the parent (Mazda) doesn't pursue volume, we won't be able to make a profit.” The parts-maker’s sales in the most recent business year were down slightly from the previous year, while Mazda posted record sales. In the fiscal year that ended in March 2022, Mazda's break-even point was below 1 million units, as it improved production efficiency amid parts shortages caused by the pandemic and it also raised unit prices. While Mazda's business foundation has become stronger, parts suppliers suffered, as their basic strategy is to sell in large volumes. Mazda has indicated that it will expand cooperation with local suppliers beyond powertrains. However, an executive at a company that also knows other automakers said, ""Many of Mazda's suppliers are small companies. As the shift to electrification progresses, the shakeout will accelerate. There is the option of switching to a business that does not rely on Mazda.” The semiconductor industry, backed by government support, has the potential to offer opportunities for local suppliers. As was seen in a massive investment by Micron Memory Japan at its Hiroshima plant, there is growing space for related firms to do business in the industry. Akinobu Teramoto, director of the Research Institute for Nanodevices at Hiroshima University, welcomes a possible shift in business models. ""Parts manufacturers can advance into chip production equipment if they accumulate expertise in fields such as clean rooms,” he said. Mazda’s latest drive for electrification is not the first time local suppliers have been affected by larger firms' strategies. The semiconductor industry is also undergoing changes. Amid such a volatile environment, Mazda and parts manufacturers are trying to find a new balance in how closely they work together.

139286115,"Fresh hope to save Wilko and protect 12,000 jobs: Private equity firm tables 11th-hour £90m rescue...","A private equity firm has offered an £90million rescue deal in a fresh bid to save Wilko and its 12,000 jobs - just days after after HMV's owner announced his interest in the retail chain. The equity firm, M2 Capital, confirmed today it has put in the 11th-hour bid to save Wilko, which is on the brink of collapse after falling into administration earlier this month. The firm's managing director Robert Mantse told the BBC that if his offer was accepted by administrators for Wilko, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), M2 will endeavour to 'guarantee all employees' jobs for two years'. Last week HMV tycoon Doug Putman emerged as Wilko's most likely saviour with him tabling a last-ditch multi-million-pound rescue offer. The 39-year-old owns the British CD seller and Canada's largest toy business Toys R Us, and in talks with administrators PwC to buy part of the business. A private equity firm has offered an £90million rescue deal in a fresh bid to save Wilko and its 12,000 jobs The equity firm, M2 Capital, confirmed today it has put in the 11th-hour bid to save Wilko. Pictured is the firm's managing director Robert Mantse Retail mogul Doug Putman, 39, whose firm, Sunrise Records, bought HMV in 2019, is understood to currently be in talks with Wilko bosses He has proposed to keep around 200 of its 400 shops and between 3,000 and 4,000 of its 12,000 staff. The deal would also mean the survival of the Wilko brand. Administrators were said to be working through the weekend to analyse a final bid from Mr Putman, in order to secure the best outcome for creditors and staff. The retail chain's profits plummeted by £38.7 million last year as sales fell by 3.3 per cent to £1.2 billion, and with profits taking a blow from rising inflation. The budget-chain had become a staple for Britain's shoppers who are after stationery, gardening supplies, homeware, cleaning products, or just a pot of pick-and-mix. It comes as today Wilko's former boss of 15 years Gordon Brown criticised the founder's granddaughter Lisa Wilkinson for ditching the tried-and-tested strategy of discount prices, and for veering away from 'their successful model of low price, low cost'. Wilko's managing director from 1992 to 2007 told The Mail on Sunday: 'Wilko was a convenience store where you went to buy bits and pieces for your house for a low price.' He added: 'They paid consultants who helped them bring about a new format for stores. 'But they were less aggressive on pricing and their approach on the shop floor.' Wilko's former managing director from 1992 to 2007 Gordon Brown has criticised management for veering away from 'their successful model of low price, low cost' Lisa Wilkinson says they would have only survived for a couple of months longer if they had not paid out any dividends Ms Wilkinson is the granddaughter of founder James Kempsey Wilkinson and took over the reins of the chain in 2014 when she bought her majority stake in Wilko from cousin Karin Swann, also a granddaughter of the founder. Wilko's ailing finances did not stop the chain from dishing out £77 million to the owners and former shareholders in the decade before its collapse. READ MORE: Wilko heads towards administration: Why is the UK brand on the brink of collapse? Advertisement The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this month the biggest payout was £63 million in 2015 when – after 85 years of running the business together – one side of the Wilkinson family sold their shares to the other. The payouts have been heavily criticised by union bosses with 12,000 staff members on the verge of becoming unemployed and a £50 million black hole in the company's pension pot, reported the BBC. GMB national secretary, Andy Prendergast, said: 'GMB union will continue to support members through this process and will fight to ensure members are consulted as per the law and that you receive every penny you are entitled to. 'We will fight to ensure Wilko bosses are held accountable for the simple reason our members deserve so much better. 'GMB will not forget the incompetence that has led to this collapse and we will not forget the dividends paid to the millionaires who gambled your jobs on their whims.' Ms Wilkinson defended the huge payouts during the loss-making period and pointed to its £100 million worth of assets and a healthy bank balance of £58 million at the time. Wilko's ailing finances did not stop the chain from dishing out £77 million to the owners and former shareholders in the decade before its collapse. There is a reported £50 million black hole in its pension pot The fate of workers hangs in the balance after administrator PwC said it had been unable to secure a deal for all 400 Wilko stores She told The Times 'the board checked... there was sufficient cash, we went through the right governance, the auditors checked it off'. 'Is there a bit of me lying awake at night saying I wish we'd never taken a penny of dividends out?,' she said. READ MORE: Full list of Wilko stores at risk of closing down as High Street retailer on brink of administration Advertisement 'Well, genuinely, would it have made any difference to where we are today? It might have made us survive a couple of months longer. What we have taken out really wouldn't have made a difference.' Nadine Houghton, of the GMB union that represents 3,500 Wilko staff, called on Ms Wilkinson to dip into her own pocket and 'use some of her millions to help prop up workers' pension pots'. She added: 'Lisa Wilkinson hasn't even had the decency to speak to workers.' Answering the door at their £3 million home in Cambridge, Wilkinson's husband Chris Phillips said: 'I'm sorry, I don't want to be rude, but we don't want to talk about it.' He then closed the door without saying another word. AHWL, the management company for the remaining family owners after the split, said family members had not received dividends since 2017. AHWL owned 99.7 per cent of Wilko up until its collapse. The fate of workers hangs in the balance after administrator PwC said it had been unable to secure a deal for all 400 Wilko stores. The retail chain's profits plummeted by £38.7 million last year as sales fell by 3.3 per cent to £1.2 billion, and with profits taking a blow from rising inflation Billionaire B&M brothers Simon, Bobby and Robin Arora had been touted as eyeing up a bid for the hardware and household discounter. While rumours have swirled that rivals Poundland, Home Bargains, and The Range were also potential suitors. Meanwhile, Poundstretcher has ruled itself out of any rescue package. Wilko, known then as Wilkinson's, started as a single hardware store 151 Charnwood Street in Leicester in 1930. The shop - known as 'Old Charney' was opened by JK Wilkinson and then Mary Cooper, who were engaged to be married at the time. By 1940, the Wilkinson started to use motorised transport, a Jowett van, for customer deliveries. Most stores managed to stay open during the Second World War to keep residents' air raid shelters and converted cellars well stocked. The chain continued to grow and by the end of the 1990s there were 152 stores across the UK. In 2008 Wilko expanded further afield with its first ever Wilko Asia. Five years later it spread to the Indian sub-continent with an office in Delhi. In 2018 another office opens in Istanbul in Turkey and it is rebranded as Wilko Worldwide.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12450775/Wilko-Private-equity-firm-rescue-HMV-owner-chain.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/27/14/74765489-0-image-m-13_1693142341800.jpg,2023-08-27 20:06:55,Editor,en,gb,0.001
139697105,"""If Supply Chains Disrupted, Whole World Suffers"": S Jaishankar To NDTV","The key issue facing the B20 grouping is supply chain, especially after the Covid pandemic showed how issues in supply chain can disrupt economies, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar told NDTV in an exclusive interview. B20 is the official dialogue forum of G20 to engage with the global business community. ""The key issue before B20 is the supply chain. Manufacturing is over-concentrated. The pandemic proved that a situation like this can disrupt economies,"" Dr Jaishankar said. He said there is a need to focus on ways to democratise the global supply chain and how to encourage green growth through sustainability. The minister added that it was critical to plug the gaps in investment flow, digital equity and gender issues. ""If G20 doesn't raise these issues, who will?"" he asked. The External Affairs Minister said the world will come to India ""because it has capacity and capability"". ""Obviously, there will be geopolitics in play. But it is important for us to find ways of growing manufacturing in this country. Because this is a pro-employment policy. There is a big opportunity for us: the world wants more supply chains, and it wants to see transparency,"" he said, adding that India should not be seen as ""China+1"". The massive impact of the pandemic and the Ukraine conflict on global supply chain had resulted in steep rise in the prices of essential commodities across the world. The world is eyeing solutions to its supply chain concerns caused by health crises, disasters, and geopolitical events. The coronavirus crisis and the Ukraine war are among the recent events that disrupted the global supply chain, resulting in steep price rises across the world. Against this backdrop, India is pushing hard to emerge as a global manufacturing hub and an alternative to China. In the B20 summit in Delhi Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined India's role in building an efficient and trusted global supply chain. In his keynote address at the closing session of the Summit, the Prime Minister recalled how India supplied vaccines beyond the borders and emerged as the 'Pharmacy of the World' during the pandemic. ""When the world needed medicines during the Covid pandemic, India, as the 'Pharmacy of the World', provided life-saving drugs to more than 150 countries. When the world needed a Covid drug, India enhanced production of its own vaccines to save the precious lives of millions across the globe,"" he said. The Prime Minister pitched for a sustainable approach to business and said global businesses should understand that sustainability itself is an opportunity and a business model.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/if-supply-chains-disrupted-whole-world-suffers-s-jaishankar-to-ndtv-4339461,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-08/a29dct7_jaishankar-ndtv-650_650x400_29_August_23.jpg,2023-08-29 13:40:00,,en,in,-0.08
139730757,"As New Opportunities Emerge, the U.S. Offshore Wind Industry Is Ready for Takeoff","Originally published on TriplePundit Offshore wind energy is relatively new to the U.S., with the first offshore turbines coming online less than 10 years ago. As with any new industry, its impact on the national economy has yet to take shape, but signs of activity are already beginning to stir. A look at the current landscape indicates offshore wind will exercise a strong and sustainable influence over business growth and job creation in the U.S. in the years to come, while also helping to shepherd the global economy into a more sustainable energy profile. Vast opportunities in the U.S. offshore wind industry Compared to land-based wind farms, it may seem difficult, cumbersome and expensive at first glance to send wind turbines out to sea. However, there are several significant advantages. Wind speeds are stronger and more efficient on the open ocean, larger areas are available for development, and offshore wind farms can serve high-population coastal cities where land for renewable energy development is scarce. In addition, the massive wind turbines of today can be shipped from a port-side manufacturing facility to the offshore site without encountering tunnels, bridges and other onshore obstacles. The coastal waters of the contiguous U.S. are rich in offshore wind opportunities. According to an assessment by the U.S. Department of Energy, 1.5 terawatts – 1,500 gigawatts -- of offshore wind energy are technically available for development with conventional, fixed-bottom wind turbines. New floating turbine technology has opened up an additional 2.8 terawatts in waters that are too deep for conventional turbines. The U.S. offshore wind industry is gearing up In other parts of the world, the offshore wind industry is already well underway — and accelerating. In Europe, for example, Denmark installed the first offshore turbines in 1991. It took 30 years for Europe’s total offshore capacity to reach 14.6 gigawatts in 2021. The EU is targeting another 45 gigawatts of offshore capacity in less than 10 years and 300 gigawatts by 2050. In the U.S., the nation’s first commercially operating offshore wind farm is the Block Island wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. It came online in 2016 with just five turbines and a total capacity of 30 megawatts. Seven years later, Block Island still remains the nation’s only commercially operating wind farm, but not for long. A new, streamlined offshore wind area leasing process and more vigorous support from public policymakers has finally opened up the U.S. market and set the stage for a new burst of economic activity. Helping to accelerate the U.S. offshore wind industry are legacy maritime firms like Crowley, which have the experience and knowledge base to take a new maritime industry under their wing by leveraging supply chain capabilities and the nation’s substantial port-side infrastructure opportunities. Massachusetts, for example, has set a goal of 5.6 gigawatts in offshore wind capacity by 2030. The state enlisted Crowley to provide terminal operations and other support for the new Salem Offshore Wind Terminal, which is nearing the construction phase. In an interesting twist on the decarbonization story, the terminal site once housed a 750-megawatt coal and oil power plant. The plant was shut down in 2014, and part of the site now houses a gas power plant. Crowley is tasked with designing, constructing and providing operational logistics services for wind developers serving projects for Massachusetts and other New England states. That includes vessels, onsite logistics and broader supply chain management, as well as maintenance support once the turbines are operational. Along with supplying clean energy, the New England states’ push toward offshore wind is set to create an infusion of new jobs in wind, maritime and related industry. “We see the need for mariners, stevedores, logisticians and technicians — roles and careers that will add value to the supply chain and wind industries and also benefit the communities’ economies,” said Bob Karl, senior vice president and general manager of Crowley Wind Services. “In addition, the project will support workforce in the construction phase beginning late 2023-2024.” In support of wind industry employment, Crowley also partnered with the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in a first-of-its-kind training and workforce development program tailored to the New England offshore wind energy industry. Meeting the floating offshore wind challenge The waters of the Atlantic coast are relatively shallow, making them ideal for fixed-bottom wind turbines. The Pacific coast is deeper, requiring new floating wind technology. Crowley is also pursuing opportunities there, as California works toward a statewide goal of at least 5 gigawatts in offshore wind energy by 2030. Planners anticipate the waters off Humboldt Bay in Northern California can provide 1.6 gigawatts of that amount. Crowley’s Wind Services business unit is developing a new marine terminal there to service the region’s floating offshore wind sector. “Services there will support tenants in the manufacturing, installation and operation of offshore wind floating platforms, use of large heavy cargo vessels, and providing crewing and marshaling services in the Pacific waters,” according to the company. Floating wind technology is relatively nascent, but there is a strong overlap with traditional maritime services. The key functions are heavy lift capabilities and other supportive operations that are well within its skill set, Karl said. “Crowley has decades of experience supporting the energy industry, and the assets and services we have operated in the past — tugs and barges, terminals, marine engineering — can help develop, build and sustain wind installations on the U.S. East, West and Gulf Coasts,” he told us. “Crowley has been supporting large assets and equipment installations, as well as providing supply chain services that has helped the energy sector in the past, and these capabilities are applicable now,” he continued. ""The use of our supply chain management experience, asset support for offshore projects and history of operating terminals is a natural fit for supporting renewable energy in offshore wind.” Economic development and decarbonization, too Crowley includes itself in the trend toward decarbonization, with an eye on its full value chain as well as its own operations. The company aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050 and published its second annual sustainability report detailing its decarbonization efforts this summer. The reports highlighted Crowley’s first-of-its-kind electric tugboat, the use of liquified natural gas instead of conventional maritime fuel, and the recent endowment of the Crowley Center for Transportation and Logistics as an innovation hub at the University of Florida’s Coggin College of Business in Jacksonville. Crowley added to its innovation roster last year in a joint venture with the shipbuilding firm ESVAGT, which has pioneered the use of purpose-built, specialized service operations vessels (SOVs) for offshore wind construction personnel. The venture is building a new SOV for coastal Virginia wind installations. Follow the money to a new Industrial Revolution Crowley expects construction at the Salem facility to begin later this year., and the company has established an office in California to oversee the terminal development at Humboldt Bay. In Louisiana, the company has the right of first refusal to develop and operate a wind terminal at Port Fourchon. “We are also building out more engineering, procurement and construction capabilities for project management so energy companies can leverage end-to-end, turnkey services as the nascent wind industry in the U.S. takes off,” Karl said. Despite opposition by some fossil energy interests and other stakeholders, the U.S. offshore wind industry has the potential to lead a 21st-century Industrial Revolution. Progress will continue to accelerate if public policy in support of decarbonization continues to gather force. “Crowley is committed to reaching net-zero emissions across all our scopes, not just our operations but our full value chain including our suppliers and partners,” Karl said. “Not only is clean, renewable energy from wind consistent with Crowley’s commitment to reaching net-zero, it helps our communities, and the people there enjoy a more sustainable future.” This article series is sponsored by Crowley and produced by the TriplePundit editorial team.

143944183,The Value of Chain of Custody Certification: How Retailers Are Meeting Consumer Preference for Responsibly Sourced and Sustainable Goods,"In recent years, global demand for sustainable and responsibly sourced wood products has surged, fueled by increasing awareness of deforestation, climate change, and a growing desire among consumers to support ethical, conscious brands. To address this demand and demonstrate their commitment, major retailers such as Wayfair, Costco, H&M, The Home Depot, and Target have embraced third-party certifications in their supply chains. These certifications have become essential for suppliers wishing to access the expanding global market for responsibly sourced and sustainable goods. Among these certifications, the forestry Chain of Custody (CoC) certifications, including those from Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®), SFI, and PEFC, have emerged as a key and recognizable option for suppliers of wood and paper products. What is CoC Certification? CoC certification, provided by accredited third-party certification bodies, ensures that wood and paper products meet strict responsible sourcing standards and ensures traceability throughout the supply chain. Product manufacturers, brokers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers can all participate by obtaining CoC certification. This certification signals their dedication to supporting responsible forestry management practices, biodiversity conservation, and the well-being of local communities. Consumer Demand for Sustainable Products Consumer research, such as the 2021 Global Sustainability Study, shows increased preference for more sustainable products. Consumers are also deeply troubled about climate change and deforestation. In another 2021 study conducted by GlobeScan for FSC, which surveyed 12,000 consumers in 15 countries, consumers listed climate change as their second-most important global concern, after disease and health. In addition, with respect to forests specifically, the participants identified the loss of plant and animal species, and the link between deforestation and climate change, as their top two concerns. Clearly, many of today's consumers are more environmentally aware than ever before and prefer brands that align with their values. As a result, they seek products that have more accountability, transparency, and purpose. It is also worth noting that surveys consistently suggest that a large majority of consumers are willing to pay a premium for products that come from sustainable and ethically sourced materials, though in practice, this purchasing behavior is often contingent on other factors, such as the scale of mark-up and the product’s perceived competitive performance. As a result, large retailers recognize the importance of catering to these consumer preferences to maintain their competitive edge and brand loyalty. The Pivotal Role of Retailers in Driving Sustainability The largest retailers, responding to consumer demand, are beginning to require adoption of certifications such as CoC. This helps to create a brand halo for the retailers themselves, communicating their commitment to environmental and social responsibility and establishing themselves as leaders, while simultaneously giving a leg up to suppliers who can comply. Such mandates have a ripple effect through the entire supply chain and send a strong message that responsible practices are not only preferred, but necessary for doing business in today’s retail climate. The retail landscape is ever-changing, with sustainability rapidly becoming a differentiating factor for success. Suppliers that fail to meet the evolving market demands for ethically and environmentally sourced goods may find themselves at a disadvantage. By keeping pace, suppliers avoid risks, reduce supply chain uncertainty, and increase investor confidence. Benefits and Opportunities for Suppliers While obtaining CoC certification may require an initial investment in time and resources in order to adhere to stringent sustainability criteria, the long-term benefits for suppliers are significant. Apart from gaining access to the growing market for sustainable products, certification enhances a supplier's reputation, strengthens relationships with conscious consumers, and attracts business from eco-minded distributors. There are hidden benefits of certification, too. For example, regular document review and external scrutiny by a neutral third-party provides a clear roadmap for internal improvements in areas that might otherwise go unnoticed. Suppliers that undergo certification frequently note that the process helps them improve their practices, promoting better management of forest resources and responsible supply chain operations. This, in turn, positively impacts the environment and local communities while fostering a more resilient and robust supply chain. The adoption of CoC certification by major suppliers and retailers is indicative of a broad shift toward more accountability for positive environmental and social impacts. As consumers continue to prioritize eco-friendly products, the demand for CoC-certified goods will continue to rise. According to FSC, there has been increased adoption of certification within key industries including textiles, packaging, natural rubber, and furniture. In addition, FSC-certified products are now accepted in Amazon’s Climate Pledge Friendly program, giving suppliers with FSC-certified products an additional advantage in the global marketplace. Beginning the CoC Certification Process with SCS As the focus on sustainability intensifies, FSC, SFI and PEFC CoC certifications will continue to play a decisive role in shaping the supply chains of major retailers and companies, and in driving positive change across industries. For suppliers, obtaining CoC certification is not only a means of meeting market demand but also an opportunity to enhance their reputation, attract eco-conscious customers, open new markets, and contribute to a greener future. SCS offers many other certifications as well as CoC. As a wood products producer or trader, your company may be interested in pursuing more than just CoC certification.

143017005,HMV's bid to rescue troubled Wilko COLLAPSES as administrators 'prepare to sell 100 stores to...,"A Wilko rescue deal proposed by HMV owner Doug Putman has collapsed, with the retailer's administrators now expected to try to sell about 100 stores to Poundland. The Range is also now set to buy the Wilko brand as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) continues to try to save as many of its 400 stores and 12,500 employees as possible. Canadian businessman Mr Putman's proposed deal fell through after weeks of talks over a deal that could have saved hundreds of stores and jobs, reported Sky News. It comes after PwC last week named the first 52 Wilko shops across Britain that will shut either tomorrow or this Thursday, which will result in the loss of 1,016 staff. Discount chain B&M has agreed to buy up to 51 stores and other parties have been speaking to PwC about acquiring the remaining 300 after the 52 shut this week. Unlike Wilko, discount retailers B&M and Poundland have cashed in on demand for affordable homeware and miscellaneous goods amid the cost of living crisis. Mr Putman told The Sun today: 'It is with great disappointment that we can no longer continue in the purchase process for Wilko having worked with administrators and suppliers over several weeks to seek a viable way to rescue it as a going concern.' Sources claimed they 'had tried very hard to make it work but it had been just too difficult with running costs and suppliers, it was always going to be a challenge'. The main issue blocking the deal was said to have been the prohibitive cost of replacing the retailer's old legacy supply chain and moving to a new system. Mr Putman added: 'We had financing in place and received the full support of PWC, Wilko management and staff representatives, which we are deeply thankful for considering what a challenging time it has been for them. 'However, commitment to overhauling the trading framework of the business with partners and the costs of running Wilko's legacy operations infrastructure combined has meant that a stable foundation could not be secured to ensure long term success for the business and its people in the way that we would have wanted.' Mr Putman is thought to have wanted around 200 stores and had offered to pay off £40million of debt to creditor Hilco. He was also said to have been keen to purchase the Wilko brand, which would have meant its signature red logo stayed on high streets. Meanwhile it was also reported that suppliers are demanding overdue payments from administrators, which has slowed down the sake process. Last week, PwC said 'it is possible that further store closures may regrettably be necessary' after naming the first 52 shops to close. There will be closures tomorrow and on Thursday across the UK in locations ranging from Bishop Auckland and Barrow in Furness to Hammersmith in West London and Weston-super-Mare. Last week a further 299 redundancies at two distribution centres in Worksop in Nottinghamshire and Newport in south Wales were announced – taking the total number of jobs lost to 1,601 since Wilko crashed into administration on August 10. Discount chain B&M agreed to buy up to 51 shops. It is thought to want to rebrand the Wilko stores it is buying as it expands its high street presence. But it remains uncertain how many staff will be kept on. Jonathan De Mello, retail analyst at JDM Retail, previously warned that it was possible only 25 per cent of Wilko's stores could be rescued should the deal with Mr Putman fall through. Wilko was founded by JK Wilkinson in 1930 with a single shop in Leicester. It outlasted the demise of rival Woolworths after the financial crisis in 2008. But its leadership and owners have been criticised after £77million was handed to former shareholders in the past decade – first reported by the Mail on Sunday – including during years when the firm made a loss. Lisa Wilkinson, granddaughter of the founder, stepped down as chairwoman of the board earlier this year after the group secured emergency cash funding in the hope of stabilising the business. Last week the GMB union, which has about 3,000 members who worked for Wilko, criticised previous management of the beleaguered chain for failing to rescue the business and protect jobs. It said: 'We make no apology for placing the blame squarely on the shoulders of the previous family director and board chair, and will continue to highlight her role in destroying what was a successful business whilst taking millions in dividends.' Chief executive Mark Jackson said the management team 'left no stone unturned' in attempting to revive Wilko in the lead-up to its collapse last month. Last week B&M apologised for appearing to make light of Wilko's crisis after it agreed to buy some of its shops. In a now-deleted post on social media, the homeware chain said: 'Popped into B&M for a few things and left with 51 Wilko stores. Happens to the best of us.' It was criticised for being tone deaf given more than 1,600 job losses at Wilko stores. B&M said: 'This post has been removed. It should not have been made and we apologise for the offence it has caused.' B&M was taken over by Simon and Bobby Arora in 2004 and has more than 700 stores. Simon stood down as chief executive last year. It also emerged last week that Aldi is eyeing up former Wilko stores and could hire workers from the chain. Aldi has said it wants to open 500 more shops in the UK after marking the opening of its 1,000th store in Surrey as part of its expansion plans. Its UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley said it could use former Wilko stores for new sites sites. Asked whether Also is looking at ex-Wilko stores, its UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley told the Daily Mirror last week: 'Clearly, with an ambitious target of 1,500 stores, we will look at all the opportunities. It comes down to the availability and suitability.' Aldi has called for staff affected by the collapse of Wilko to get in touch because it has about 6,000 jobs currently available.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12503709/Wilko-administrators-prepare-sell-100-stores-Poundland.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/09/11/08/75285447-0-image-a-19_1694417060153.jpg,2023-09-11 09:50:59,Editor,en,gb,-0.586
138905633,Canada Probes Slavery Allegations in Walmart and Hugo Boss Supply Chains,"The Canadian Ombudsman for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) announced on Thursday it is investigating the Canadian branches of Walmart, Hugo Boss, and Diesel for the alleged use of Uyghur slavery in their supply chains. CORE is a human rights watchdog agency whose purview includes human rights abuses along international supply chains connected to corporations in Canada. CORE can act on both referrals and its own initiative. In this case, CORE acted on allegations from human rights groups that Chinese suppliers for the three firms used slaves from the oppressed Uyghur Muslims of East Turkistan, which China calls Xinjiang. Forced labor contamination is an especially pernicious problem in the garment industry since China provides a great deal of the world’s cotton, and Xinjiang produces almost 90 percent of China’s supply. CORE’s ombudsman and chief spokeswoman, Sheri Meyerhoffer, said Friday that Walmart, Hugo Boss, and Diesel all refused to participate in a preliminary assessment of the slavery reports, so her agency had no choice but to launch an investigation: The investigations will provide all three companies with an ongoing opportunity to provide further relevant information, and mediation of the allegations remains open. We are hopeful that the investigation findings will provide the companies with information to support their ability to strengthen their due diligence practices. All three companies denied they purchased goods tainted by forced labor. A spokesperson for Hugo Boss said the company “does not source any goods in its direct supply relationship that originate from the Xinjiang region.” “As a matter of principle, we do not tolerate forced or compulsory labor or any form of modern slavery. We believe it is wrong to launch an investigation based on an alleged supplier relationship which no longer exists,” the spokesperson said, alluding to a relationship with a supplier that ended in 2022. Hugo Boss was among several brands that purchased cotton from the Changji Esquel Group, a massive Chinese supplier that made efforts to conceal its sourcing of cotton from Xinjiang. When human rights groups exposed Esquel’s practices, some of its clients terminated their relationships. Hugo Boss initially said it had audited Esquel’s operations and found no trace of slavery, but in February 2022, it quietly severed its ties with the Chinese supplier. According to a report at JustStyle on Friday, the coalition of human rights groups that complained to CORE said there is “evidence that the company linked to Hugo Boss Canada owns a subsidiary in Xinjiang, purchases Xinjiang cotton, engages in state-sponsored labor transfers, and purchases cotton from a Xinjiang based cotton provider.” Diesel, an Italian-owned fashion company, purchased garments from a company called Jiangsu Guotai Guosheng, which allegedly employs Uyghur slaves. Walmart was accused of doing business with a half-dozen companies under suspicion of using slavery, including Jiangsu Guotai Guosheng. Diesel said in response to the CORE investigation: Diesel is deeply committed to ethical sourcing. We respect global human rights and comply with international laws across our supply chain. We take immediate remedial and disciplinary action if we find that any supplier is not acting in accordance with our code of conduct. Walmart Canada likewise said it “does not tolerate forced labor of any kind” in its supply chain and takes “allegations of human rights violations seriously”: Walmart made it clear to the CORE that we have developed and executed policies, standards, controls, and supply chain monitoring systems that support Walmart Canada’s corporate mandate to prohibit the use of forced labor. Our policies are diligently enforced. CORE replied that Diesel’s refusal to participate in preliminary assessments raised “questions related to the degree of transparency in its human rights due diligence practices,” while Hugo Boss “does not appear to consider fully the complex nature of the garment supply chain.”",https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/08/25/canada-probes-slavery-allegations-in-walmart-and-hugo-boss-supply-chains/,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/08/Uyghur-640x335.jpeg,2023-08-26 05:19:55,John Hayward,en,us,-0.085
140687665,How A Potential UAW Strike Would Have Significant Ramifications On Auto Logistics - WorldNewsEra,"The UAW’s contracts with the Detroit 3 expire Sept. 14. The industry is bracing for the possibility of a strike that could result in billions of dollars in economic losses if the union and automakers are not able to come to an agreement. The logistics industry remains in a somewhat fragile state, as evidenced by the Aug. 7 bankruptcy of trucking company Yellow Corp., a once-dominant player that laid off 30,000 workers when it halted operations. A strike would further complicate business for transportation companies and have “significant” effects in the long run, said Thomas Goldsby, a professor at the University of Tennessee’s Global Supply Chain Institute. “It’s really about the level of dedication companies have to the auto industry,” he said. “Those folks that are dedicated are going to be particularly nervous in the coming weeks.” Goldsby said companies have attempted to diversify their customer bases over the last several years, as supply chain challenges demonstrated the risks of relying too heavily on a single customer or industry. Others are likely to dedicate more resources to shipping other industries’ goods in the event of a prolonged strike, he said. “They’ll say, ‘OK, we have warehouse space and trucks in place, so how can we redeploy those assets?’ And they can redeploy them,” he said. “We’re getting close to the peak shipping season for the holidays, and if they’re running tight on inventory for consumer goods, conceivably they could repurpose that space.” Given those factors and the financial pressures suppliers have dealt with over the past few years, You encouraged parts makers to proactively open lines of communication among their customers, suppliers and logistics companies. In particular, she said it would be important for suppliers to ask to customers what their ordering plans would be in the event of a strike and to communicate what lead times might be to return to full-volume production after it ends. “This is not the flip-the-switch sort of industry where suppliers can go from zero to 100 overnight, but that might be the expectation of your customer when the strike ends,” she said. “It’s important [suppliers] set the expectation now for what a production ramp-up looks like in the event that their ordering is completely stopped for the duration of the strike.” Suppliers should also have a clear idea of what parts are being shipped into their facilities from overseas, a process that could take weeks and leave them storing components for an indefinite period of time, You said. “The reality of operating in a global industry where the parts you need to produce a component are an ocean away, that means you might’ve ordered parts several weeks ago in compliance with forecasts you received from your customers,” she said. “But once they finally get here in two weeks, you might not have a use for them during the duration of the strike.” It’s a situation that could be costly to suppliers, since companies don’t get paid for parts until they sell the product they’re used in, she said. “This is a just-in-time industry, so a lot of facilities have limited capacity for storing inventory,” You said. “Maybe there’s some warehousing you can do off-site, but that costs money to do.”",https://worldnewsera.com/automobile/how-a-potential-uaw-strike-would-have-significant-ramifications-on-auto-logistics/,https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/logistics-MAIN.jpg,2023-09-02 05:42:44,Evelyn Blackwell,en,us,-0.343
139045197,Green Protectionism: A Dangerous Consensus—2023 China Focus Essay The Jimmy Carter First Prize Winner,"Sino-American hostility is metastasizing into renewable energy markets. This is bad news for global prosperity, and it is worse news for the planet. American policymakers have become increasingly enamored with green protectionism, a policy paradigm aimed at shielding domestic renewable products from foreign—particularly Chinese—competition. Despite its stated climate ambitions, the Biden administration has quietly embraced its predecessor’s solar safeguard tariffs and import quotas. The Inflation Reduction Act, its flagship legislative accomplishment, passed sweeping electric vehicle (EV) subsidies and tax credits—but conditioned them on locally-produced components. In his remarks on an executive order promoting the domestic mining and processing of rare earth elements, Biden said: “China has spent years cornering the market … That’s why I committed us to build a clean energy supply chain stamped ‘Made in America.’” The desire to onshore the renewable supply chain has also taken root in a growingly hawkish Congress, where a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers is moving to reimpose tariffs of up to 254% on four Southeast Asian countries. Their aim is to stop “tariff-jumping” by Chinese manufacturers, many of which have relocated to Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Together, these countries account for 80% of US solar imports. Congress’s eye-watering tariff hike, which could muster a veto-proof supermajority, demonstrates the growing danger of green protectionism: policymakers could become so engrossed in great-power competition that they throttle clean energy adoption at home. Green protectionism is as dangerous as it is pervasive. Taxes on Chinese renewable imports drive up the cost of clean energy, provoke retaliation, and prolong the US’s dependence on fossil fuels. The American government should substantially reduce its tariffs on foreign-produced solar and wind components, including those that are subsidized. A smarter doctrine for green policy—what I term “comparative advantage plus”—would accentuate the American economy’s strengths rather than compensate for its weaknesses. Instead of attempting to squeeze the entire renewable supply chain into the United States, policymakers should subsidize areas where it enjoys a structurally favorable position, such as research and development (R&D). THE ORIGIN OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TARIFFS American green protectionism began brewing when US solar manufacturers accused China of product dumping — selling its products at below-market prices to drive out competition. As early as the 2010s, commentators attributed inexpensive Chinese renewables to a government-led campaign of aggressive currency manipulation and illegal subsidization aimed at undercutting American exporters. The Obama administration addressed these complaints in 2012 by launching an investigation into unfair Chinese trade practices and slapping preliminary tariffs on Chinese solar cells and panels. Two years later, the administration solidified these into permanent countervailing and antidumping tariffs and extended them to Taiwan. The trade-skeptical Trump administration entrenched this approach. In 2018, US officials imposed additional safeguard tariffs and import quotas on most foreign-made solar panels. The Biden administration extended both, though it made some exemptions and pledged to small rate reductions each year. Renewable protectionism has been accentuated by the rise of a broader hawkish consensus on China across administrations. Suspicion toward the PRC, stoked by its rapid military modernization and regional assertiveness, has become ubiquitous in US foreign policy circles. Lawmakers increasingly view international politics in zero-sum terms, framing Sino-American competition as an existential struggle between democracy and autocracy. National security officials fear China could weaponize the West’s dependence on its energy supplies to extract concessions or break American resolve in a crisis. In an era of emerging great-power rivalry, Chinese green energy has become radioactive. Joint ventures between US and Chinese firms to build manufacturing plants in America now incite broad backlash from local and national officials. The Chinese EV battery firm Gotion, for example, faced allegations that its proposed factory in Michigan would “spread Communism, bring in thousands of Chinese workers and hide ballistic missiles.” It’s no wonder that tariffs are in vogue. When you’re hammering out foreign influence, Chinese joint ventures look like a nail. AGAINST GREEN PROTECTIONISM There are many compelling reasons to reject green protectionism. First, it endangers the domestic transition to clean energy. The rise of globalized supply chains has enabled nations to specialize, aggregating the strengths of each participant. The US, with its impressive reserves of human capital and cutting-edge research institutions, can supply transnational firms with innovations and product testing. China, on the other hand, wields a comparative advantage in manufacturing renewable products. It enjoys vast natural resources, a deep and flexible labor pool, and a sprawling mass production infrastructure. Connecting these advantages through global supply chains has led to dramatic cost reductions. Open access to China’s economic infrastructure is thus indispensable to a low-carbon future. Tariffs, however, are one reason the US has some of the highest solar costs in the world. The scale of national electrification required to meet the Biden administration’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which pledged to halve US carbon emissions from their 2005 levels, is staggering. The US needs to multiply its current rate of renewables installation several times over, which will demand a Herculean effort of ambitious grid build-outs and renewable energy installations. Cost reductions are the key to rapid decarbonization. Scaling up renewables demands vast sums of private financing to cover the up-front cost of constructing new energy infrastructure. The lower the cost, the quicker renewable energy ventures can turn a profit — and the more investors they attract. This drives a virtuous cycle whereby rising supply enables green manufacturers to tap into economies of scale, driving further cost reductions. Conversely, these projects are unlikely to attract investors if they can’t underprice incumbent fossil fuels. Higher prices mean a sluggish transition, and slowing the race to renewable energy risks locking in climate catastrophe. In the worst-case scenario, a tit-for-tat cycle of punitive trade barriers culminates in strict protectionist green energy policies. The renewable energy supply chain then bifurcates into isolated blocs, sundering the global financial network that has achieved dramatic cost reductions in renewable energy. Prices skyrocket, and import-reliant firms sink into insolvency. It is no exaggeration to say that decoupling could eat the renewable transition alive. This dovetails to a second concern with green trade barriers: retaliation. Blowback from foreign import restrictions often means policymakers will undermine one subindustry as they prop up another. China responded to the 2012 antidumping tariffs, for example, with devastating taxes on American polysilicon, causing the industry to whither. China then scaled up its own production of polysilicon. The US share of the global polysilicon market plummeted from 24% to 5%, and China’s skyrocketed from a marginal share to 70%. New tariffs could push Chinese officials toward stringent export controls on solar ingot and wafer manufacturing technology, undermining American producers. Retaliatory tariffs will likely target areas in the global supply chain where America wields a genuine comparative advantage. In other words, green protectionism will sabotage the US’s most productive and successful firms. It is analogous to, in the words of the old saying, drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. The US needs its firms to dedicate their attention and finances to uncovering cutting-edge innovations and installing enormous amounts of renewables. Green protectionism, however, presents a final concern: rent-seeking. Sheltered industries tend to develop an appetite for government protection, and they begin to sink substantial resources into prolonging it. This is rational behavior in an insulated marketplace, where firms can collect enormous unearned profits while producing much less efficiently than their competitors. Firms are likely to aggressively lobby the government for further protections, and lobbying is a costly endeavor. Rent-seeking businesses dedicate building space, money, and employees toward beguiling government officials. If protected industries depend on tariffs for their very survival, which is likely in an onshoring scenario, lobbying-related expenses may account for a startling share of their expenditures. R&D and other productivity-enhancing measures would suffer as a result. Finally, empirical evidence suggests tariffs are ineffective at shielding domestic industries. Despite generous protection, cell manufacturers Suniva and Panasonic folded in 2017 and 2020, respectively. High entry costs will make manufacturers difficult to resuscitate without substantial tariff hikes, and that is a perilous approach. Raising the prices of imports is a Band-Aid solution to a structural problem: subsidized or not, foreign manufacturers are likely to underprice American manufacturers. The US has high labor costs and a shallower pool of available workers. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging the intrinsic disadvantage US producers face vis-à-vis foreign firms. Accepting the principle of comparative advantage is what makes countries rich. There is thus little reason to believe that the US should use trade restrictions to prop up otherwise non-competitive green industries. Firms weaned on local content requirements and tariffs are unlikely to flourish. Instead, they will acquire bloat, soak up vast public resources, and obstruct the fight against climate change. A NEW PATH FORWARD: COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE PLUS The climate crisis demands a policy strategy beyond green autarky. The most compelling path forward is “comparative advantage plus.” The US government should rebuff green protectionism and slash tariffs and import duties on renewable energy, including both end-use products and intermediate components. Instead, policymakers should turn their attention to supporting the areas in the renewable supply chain where America commands a comparative advantage. The US should compete with Chinese suppliers, but it needs to pick its battles prudently. Subsidizing sectors in which the US is already poised to excel may seem counterintuitive; after all, these firms do not need government support to remain competitive. But this is a feature, not a bug, of comparative advantage plus. Industrial policy should aim to accelerate decarbonization, not shelter national champions. These firms will benefit from subsidies but remain exposed to foreign competition, encouraging them to remain on the cutting edge of green technology. The best opportunity for an expanded US commitment is knowledge-intensive R&D. Here, the government should vigorously deploy the toolbox of a green industrial policy: tax credits, low-interest loans, public purchases, and subsidies. There are a range of nascent technologies that have not yet reached cost-feasibility and would benefit from enhanced support, including low-carbon steel, direct air capture, hydrogen energy, and Advanced Small Modular Reactors. The US should step up its public funding of promising research ventures, increasing the resources available for costly projects. It could commit to purchasing the most promising technologies when they begin production, which would provide certainty to investors in a high-risk marketplace. American innovators could then forge symbiotic partnerships with Chinese manufacturers to bring their technologies to market, maximizing the efficiency of the supply chain. The US should continue providing generous support to renewable installation and maintenance projects. As observers have noted, solar installation is likely to generate significantly more jobs than manufacturing. Lowering the costs of renewable energy imports will increase uptake, offsetting the loss of factory jobs. Fears of the security risks of this policy approach are overblown. Clean energy is a far less effective tool of coercion because, unlike fossil fuels, the manufacturer has no leverage over already installed capacity. Oil and gas require a continual stream of resources; the supplier can turn off the tap at any time. Renewable energy provides no such continuous leverage. China could threaten to cut off rare earth elements used for maintenance, but recycling, substitutes, and increasing extraction make it difficult to turn individual minerals into meaningful chokepoints. The US is already dependent on China for, among other things, pharmaceuticals, credit, and many of its basic consumer goods. China is also profoundly reliant on the US as a destination market and a source of sovereign bonds. Unless policymakers are prepared to disentangle the US and Chinese economies entirely, mutual economic vulnerability will persist. Analysts should also weigh the dependence concern against the alternative: continuing to pad the treasuries of aggressive petrostates. In an age of reshoring, high fences, and inward-facing populism, American policy would benefit from a healthy dose of globalism. There is a bipartisan convergence on the need to throw up walls against Chinese goods and stimulate domestic clean energy. This expression of “green protectionism” is oxymoronic self-sabotage. It will bottleneck the renewable energy economy and stymie US progress against climate change. America needs a green industrial policy tailored to its strengths. This proposal would capitalize on the US’s advantage in experimentation and innovation, and accelerate the urgent transition from carbon-intensive energy. China is poised to pick up part of the tab for global decarbonization. American lawmakers should not become so immersed in hard-nosed competition that they snub this offer.",https://uscnpm.org/2023/08/23/green-protectionism-a-dangerous-consensus/,https://uscnpm.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manny-becerra-NgdhrwAx0J8-unsplash.jpg,2023-08-23 20:27:51,Michael B.

143789445,Expert Explains: India’s supply chain opportunity,"Amid the efforts to cut dependence on China-centric global supply chains, countries such as Vietnam have grabbed the China+1 headlines more than India. However, the announcement at the G20 Leaders’ Summit on the landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) has the potential to make India an Asian hub in global supply chains. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington DC in June showed that supply chains are at the centre of the latest chapter in India-United States relations. First, what are supply chains? Supply chains — variously described as global production networks, production fragmentation, or global value chains — refer to the geographical location of stages of production (such as design, production, assembly, marketing, and service activities) in a cost-effective manner. Global supply chains have been the leading model of industrial production since the 1980s, influencing the pace and nature of globalisation and regionalisation. The shift in industrial production from local and regional supply to global supply took place gradually over the last 100 years. Global supply chains can be found in a wide range of simple (textiles and clothing, food processing and consumer goods, etc.) and complex industries (e.g., automotives, aircraft, machinery, electronics and pharmaceuticals). Why are global supply chains moving from China? Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Western firms had begun to reduce their reliance on China, and its popularity as a sourcing market among Western buyers was diminishing. Some production stages in Chinese supply chains, particularly the labour-intensive ones, were moving to lower-cost locations. The trend was attributable in part to rising wages and supply chain bottlenecks within China, and investor concerns about tighter regulation of foreign firms. The global risks of supply chains concentrated in mainland China and Hong Kong are underlined by recent data. Exports from the two markets, which together represent 20% of world exports of intermediate goods, decreased 15% and 27% year-on-year respectively during the last quarter of 2022. Shipments from the US, which accounted for 8.1% of world exports of intermediate goods, fell by 3% while those of Japan, with 4% share, fell by 13%. The downturn, coupled with internal risks in China and the country’s trade war with the US, is forcing multinational companies to rethink their global sourcing strategies. It is costly to shift supply chains — new plants need to be set up, and workers need to be hired and trained, which makes it difficult to relocate production from China wholesale. Even so, considerations of profitability are influencing a trend of relocating production either to friendly countries or back to the US. Why is India being considered an attractive supply chain hub? Southeast Asia has beckoned foreign companies with cheap wages, fiscal incentives and improved logistics. Vietnam and Thailand are big winners in supply-chain shifting. But over time, India can become a complementary Asian manufacturing hub to China by reaping gains from foreign technology transfers and creating value-adding jobs. This is seen in the ramped-up manufacturing of iPhones in the country, early technology transfer in the product cycle of the technologically advanced Mercedes Benz EQS to India, and Foxconn Technology Group developing a chip-making fabrication plant in Gujarat. Manufacturing sectors in India such as automotives, pharmaceuticals, and electronics assembly are already sophisticated, and likely to emerge as winners in this race. India’s attractiveness to foreign investors is also linked to geopolitical and economic factors. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) lists India as the fifth largest importer of intermediate goods in 2022 Q4 with a 5% share, suggesting that supply chain pessimism on India may be altering since the pandemic. The countries ahead of India are China (23.4%), the US (16.2%), Germany (9.1%), and Hong Kong (6.0%). India could in the future double its current 1.5% share of world exports of intermediate goods. Indian service can also be a winner, including in information and communications technology, back-office work, financial and professional services, and transport and logistics. Since 2022, the Narendra Modi government’s trade policy has placed renewed emphasis on preferential trade through a flurry of bilateral deals with trading partners. The UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement entered into force in May 2022. An early harvest was reached in April 2022 for the Australia-India free trade agreement (FTA), and talks are ongoing to conclude the full FTA by the end of 2023. Negotiations for a UK-India and EU-India FTA are in process. These new deals are significant because they are with Western trading partners, and reflect plans for deep economic integration going well beyond India’s previous FTAs which focused solely on the goods trade and related measures. So, what must India do going forward? India can learn much from China’s experience. First, the promotion of export-oriented foreign direct investment (FDI) is key to participating in supply chains. A gradual stance of trade liberalisation dictates maintaining an open-door policy toward FDI in manufacturing and facilitating investment at a high level, with competitive fiscal incentives and the creation of modern special economic zones as public-private partnerships. The reduction of business hassles through digitalisation of tax, customs, and business administration, and high-quality free trade deals is essential. Second, local companies need smart business strategies to join global supply chains. Big companies naturally have advantages in supply chains due to the larger scale of production, better access to foreign technology, and the ability to spend more on marketing. Conglomerates can cross-subsidise investments and other costs among business units. Small and mid-sized enterprises should, therefore, work as industrial suppliers and subcontractors to large exporters. Business strategies like mergers, acquisitions, and alliances with multinationals and large local business houses are rational approaches. So is investment in domestic technological capabilities to achieve international standards of price, quality, and delivery. Third, caution should be exercised before India attempts to replicate China’s state interventionist template wholesale, as there is a significant risk of government failure and cronyism. It may be prudent to actively engage with think tanks to gain insights into what might work. Still, some aspects of China’s industrial policy may be relevant to India, including better targeting of multinationals in new industrial activities in which there may be a potential comparative advantage and better coordination between the central and state governments. Equally important is upstream investment in tertiary-level education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Could the South Asian region as a whole benefit from this approach? India has a historic opportunity to promote industrialisation in South Asia, which would stabilise the region, increase jobs, and make it less vulnerable to Chinese enticements. Market-led spillovers from India’s supply chains through outward-foreign investment in labour-intensive manufacturing are a natural transmission channel to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India’s dynamic start-up culture, venture capital financing and fintech capacity can be used to draw in young entrepreneurs from other South Asian countries. The Indian government should consider two policy initiatives to promote regional supply chains. First, upscaling the Make in India Programme into a Make in South Asia Programme. India can provide fiscal incentives to Indian manufacturers to expand into Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which are in apparel supply chains. Food processing, textiles and apparel, and the automotive sector might be candidates for this, given India’s neighbours’ factor endowments and industrial experience. Second, India should conclude a comprehensive bilateral FTA with Bangladesh and upgrade the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA to support regional rules-based trade and investment. These initiatives can help to integrate these two countries into supply chain activities centred on India as the assembly hub, and bring mutual welfare gains in terms of industrialisation, real income growth and job creation. Unless India creates channels for South Asia, it has no offer for the Global South. The fresh supply chains opening up with the US are a good place for India to start its global integration journey, Neighborhood First.

143055509,"All 400 Wilko stores will close for good as rescue deal for troubled chain falls through with 12,500...","All 400 Wilko stores will close for good as a rescue deal for the troubled chain falls through with 12,500 jobs in peril, union bosses have said. It's thought that mass staff redundancies are now likely with all UK stores due to close by early October according to the GMB union. The chain has been the focus of a last-ditch attempt by the owner of HMV to strike a rescue deal however this failed. Administrators for the high street chain had been in discussions with Doug Putman, of Putman Investments, over a deal to buy around 200 Wilko shops. Mr Putman, founder of Putman Investments, said: 'It is with great disappointment that we can no longer continue in the purchase process for Wilko having worked with administrators and suppliers over several weeks to seek a viable way to rescue it as a going concern. 'We had financing in place and received the full support of PwC, Wilko management and staff representatives, which we are deeply thankful for considering what a challenging time it has been for them. 'However, commitment to overhauling the trading framework of the business with partners and the costs of running Wilko's legacy operations infrastructure combined has meant that a stable foundation could not be secured to ensure long-term success for the business and its people in the way that we would have wanted.' Sky News has reported that administrators from PwC are now in talks with Poundland over a potential deal to offload about 100 stores. Other high street chains including The Range and Home Bargains have also reportedly signalled their interest over potentially buying the Wilko brand or stores. Wilko, which employed around 12,500 staff, has already announced a £13 million deal to sell 51 shops to B&M, although the rival discounter has not agreed to take on Wilko workers as part of the deal. Administrators have already announced more than 1,600 redundancies at Wilko in recent weeks. This week the retailer will shut 52 shops in a move which will lead to 1,016 redundancies. It said 24 of its shops will close on Tuesday September 12, with a further 28 shops due to shut on Thursday September 14. PwC has also announced hundreds of redundancies affecting workers at the firm's warehouses in Worksop and Newport, as well as cuts at its support centre. The 90-year-old retail chain tumbled into administration early last month after it came under pressure from weak consumer spending and debts to suppliers. Nadine Houghton, national officer for the GMB union, said: 'Due to the incompetency of Wilko bosses the deal has now run out of time. 'If the owners had been transparent and honest, thousands of loyal Wilko workers may not now be in this awful position. 'This is another devastating blow for them, who have seen their lives and futures gambled on the whims of millionaires and billionaires. 'Wilko bosses should be ashamed that this once great family business now appears to be beyond saving.' Wilko was founded by JK Wilkinson in 1930 with a single shop in Leicester. It outlasted the demise of rival Woolworths after the financial crisis in 2008. But its leadership and owners have been criticised after £77million was handed to former shareholders in the past decade – first reported by the Mail on Sunday – including during years when the firm made a loss. Wilko announced its collapse on August 10 blaming stubbornly high inflation and interest rates affecting businesses and consumers. It also emerged last week that Aldi is eyeing up former Wilko stores and could hire workers from the chain. Aldi has said it wants to open 500 more shops in the UK after marking the opening of its 1,000th store in Surrey as part of its expansion plans. Its UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley said it could use former Wilko stores for new sites sites. Asked whether Also is looking at ex-Wilko stores, its UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley told the Daily Mirror last week: 'Clearly, with an ambitious target of 1,500 stores, we will look at all the opportunities. It comes down to the availability and suitability.' Aldi has called for staff affected by the collapse of Wilko to get in touch because it has about 6,000 jobs currently available. Mr De Mello said: 'One potential retailer, in addition to Poundland, that could potentially acquire some Wilko stores is Aldi. 'With their ambitious plan to expand their 990 strong store portfolio to 1,500 in the next few years, they need to leave no stone unturned in their location search, and a number of Wilko stores will likely fit the bill, in terms of size, accessibility and market potential. 'Aldi have also thrown a lifeline to Wilko staff, encouraging them to apply for some of the circa 6,000 current job vacancies they have.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12504349/All-400-Wilko-stores-close-jobs.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/09/11/12/75291265-0-image-a-19_1694430943786.jpg,2023-09-11 13:17:17,Editor,en,gb,-0.14
143992525,The world’s solar panel industry is still powered by Uyghur forced labor,"Unless action is taken to stop this supply-chain bifurcation, the growing number of solar panels installed worldwide could perpetuate forced labor among China’s largest Turkic minority. By 2030, when the solar industry hopes to supply 30% of U.S. energy generation, the installation rate will rise six times to reach 350 million panels in total. While the U.S. risks becoming a “dumping ground” for solar panels made using Uyghur forced labor, Laura Murphy, author of the report from The Forced Labour Lab, told The China Project that European governments now have a chance to lead a change in the direction of the solar industry. In Early September, Norwegian Crystals, maker of solar powered bricks, or lights, and the silicon wafers used to build the bigger solar panels, filed for bankruptcy because it was unable to compete in a market flooded with Chinese polysilicon, a key ingredient of solar panels. The Scandinavian firm’s insolvency struck a blow to the continent’s supply of home-grown solar cells, and shone a spotlight on the need for regional governments to back the local solar industry with resources to combat the Chinese competitors’ Beijing-subsidized advances. In fact, the European failure could be the first in a wave of imminent “wide-scale bankruptcies in the EU’s solar sector” brought on by Chinese competition, a September 2023 Politico report showed. “There’s an opportunity for the EU to invest in the diversification of the supply chains to ensure that China’s artificially deflated prices do not mean the end of international solar manufacturing,” Murphy told The China Project. Asking for help, Solar Power Europe wrote to the European Commission, declaring “fierce competition” between Chinese suppliers to gain market shares as “deeply precarious “ for EU industry. Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of the industry group, told Politico the industry needed “80-100 million” euros ($85.44–$106.8 million) in the “next couple of weeks” to stay afloat. Though Chinese energy industry giants as Longi Solar, Trina Solar, and Jinko Solar, among others, promised to quit Xinjiang over the past few years, The Forced Labour Lab report showed that Uyghurs still form the unwilling bedrock of the workforce making cheap solar panels sold to the West. Underpinning their cost was cheap labor sourced from Uyghurs coming out of two or three years of unlawful detention across the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a remote, sparsely populated area of northwest China three times the size of France. Beginning in 2016, citing a need to stem terrorism for national security, Beijing policies led to the detention, imprisonment and forced labor of more than one million Turkic peoples, most of whom are Muslim. Detention and forced labor of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims was driven by Chén Quánguó 陈全国, then Party Secretary of Xinjiang. After two or three years of learning patriotic “Red” songs and spoken Chinese, “reformed” Uyghurs were sent around China and forced to work for little or no money making goods for Western markets, Murphy’s report showed. With funding support from the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre in London, Murphy and solar industry expert Alan Crawford found that despite a 10% drop in the solar panel raw material polysilicon being sourced from the Uyghur Region since 2020, solar supply chains had become more opaque. In the wake of the August report — the second of two of its kind from The Forced Labor Lab — Uyghur rights advocates have demanded energy companies clean up their supply chains and stop their “acrobatics” merely to gain access to the lucrative U.S. market. “Clean energy must be actually clean,” Rushan Abbas, head of Campaign for Uyghurs, a Washington D.C.-based rights group, told The China Project. Clean or mean? After scrutiny of the solar panel supply chain intensified, trade group The Solar Energy Industries Association tried to get companies to shift supply chains away from Xinjiang. In 2021, more than 340 global companies signed a pledge to rid themselves of forced labor, including 175 Chinese solar companies, but The Forced Labor Lab’s “Over-exposed” report found the abuse continued. Right at the very first stage of the solar supply chain — digging quartz rock from the earth — Uyghur forced labor is likely to be involved, presenting a moral conundrum to democratic countries trying to transition to clean energy, the report said. China controls at least 80% of global manufacturing for each stage of the solar supply chain. Murphy and Crawford’s research did a deep dive into the supply chains of 10 ten solar panel manufacturers, including the top five manufacturers that create 70% of the world’s solar modules combined. “Despite significant global pressure for increased transparency, information regarding solar industry sourcing is becoming less transparent over time, thwarting the world’s ability to source ethically,” the report said. According to PV Magazine, the world’s main solar manufacturers, all based in China, are LONGi Solar, Trina Solar, Jinko Solar, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, and Risen Energy. All have a “high” or “very high” potential exposure to Xinjiang, The Forced Labor Lab report said. Though LONGi and JA set up what they called “clean” supply chains to serve the U.S. or Europe, they still sourced raw materials with links to Xinjiang, the report showed. Information presented to Murphy’s researchers directly by solar companies was “contradictory” and the numbers often didn’t add up. “Many companies that have created supply chains purportedly free of Uyghur Region inputs continue to source from suppliers or sub-suppliers that have exposure to the Uyghur Region for other product lines,” the report said. Slow progress Campaigns to persuade governments to prioritize human rights over profits are painfully slow. In July 2020, the 400-member, non-profit Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region issued a “Call to Action” to rally brands and retailers to ensure they are not benefiting from the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Turkic and Muslim-majority peoples. On September 5, 2023, an amendment to a forthcoming U.K. Energy Bill requiring companies to demonstrate that their goods were “not mined, produced or manufactured wholly or in part by forced labor,” was debated in Parliament but then put to one side. Canadian Solar, a Chinese company planning to build in the U.K., is “complicit and among those that try to hide the reality of what they are doing,” MP Alicia Kearns said when introducing the amendment. “We’re calling for a clean energy transition without Uyghur blood labor staining our countryside,” Kearns said. “Clean energy must not be built on the back of Uyghur slavery.” Uyghur rights activists were disappointed the amendment did not pass. “Existing U.K. legislation in The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 does not go far enough to address or prevent the scourge of Uyghur forced labor entering our markets,” Michael Polak, Director of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, told The China Project. “Amendment 47 would have ensured our government and the British public were not unwittingly complicit in an industry riddled with Uyghur slavery, and doing very little to halt it.” In March 2020, when the solar industry was warned for the first time to abide by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, many companies insisted their supply chains had moved out of Xinjiang. “The UFLPA needs to be strictly enforced,” Louisa Greve, Director of Global Advocacy for the Uyghur Human Rights Project, told The China Project. “Even the industry association in the U.S. has been calling on the private sector since October 2020 to change their supply chains without delay, at least in their public messaging. Is three years not enough?” Greve added that “partial engagement” with Xinjiang was not good enough: “No profits from forced labor are acceptable,” she said. Energy companies should conduct businesses in compliance with their own ethics policies as well as the law: “Not only the UFLPA but the German due diligence law and the forthcoming EU due diligence law.” she said. “If they can’t source from a genocidal region, it’s up to them to find new sources,” Greve said, urging companies to lobby Western governments for policy changes that could pave the way for sourcing solar panels’ raw materials economically someplace outside China. “Myriad problems” stem from the surge of mining the raw materials used to make solar panels, materials such as silicon, silver, aluminum, and copper, Charlie Hoffs wrote in an October 2022 blog post for the Union of Concerned Scientists, founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969. “Can governments and companies ensure that workers in the solar supply chain benefit from safe, just, and well-compensated livelihoods — and that the communities most affected are involved as active collaborators, treated with respect and dignity?” Hoffs, a former Schneider Sustainable Energy Fellow at Stanford University, wrote. The world’s much-needed transition from fossil fuels to clean energy from solar power and other sources “must not be at the cost of people’s freedom,” Chloe Cranston, Anti-Slavery International’s Business and Human Rights Manager, told The China Project. “We urgently need governments around the world to introduce policy and financial measures to compel and incentivise the solar industry to shift sourcing”, U.K.-based Cranston said. The USA’s UFLPA was not enough; the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia and Japan all needed to get on board with introducing and enforcing import control measures, she said. For decades, Beijing’s subsidies, cheap Chinese labor, and an extensive use of dirty coal as a cheap source of energy, have allowed China to monopolize the solar panel market and block entry to competitors, Cranston said. Anti-Slavery International advocates supporting cost-competitive alternative sources for solar panel raw materials as long as they meet high social and environmental standards. “Governments and financial institutions play a critical role in addressing this, including by mobilizing finance and other measures to support the scale-up of alternatives,” Cranston said. Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs head Abbas said that the world must ensure that solar companies commit to cutting all ties to slave labor as they chart the path towards renewable energy. “It is our moral obligation to stand by the Uyghurs, who have endured unimaginable suffering and continue to do so,” Abbas said. — Jonathan Landreth contributed reporting.",https://thechinaproject.com/2023/09/14/the-worlds-solar-panel-industry-is-still-powered-by-uyghur-forced-labor/,https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/xinjiang-solar-reuters.jpg,2023-09-14 17:44:49,Ruth Ingram,en,cn,-0.309
137965749,Debt Bondage Payouts Mark Progress But Fail to Make Migrant Workers Whole in Taiwan – The Diplomat,"Excessive recruitment fees are an omnipresent burden and decade-long forced labor risk for many of Taiwan’s over 700,000 migrant workers, as they incur substantial debts to pay home-country recruiters for jobs. Vietnamese pay by far the most. In 2022, we reported on workers paying the equivalent of three to four years’ wages at home in Vietnam for jobs at Taiwanese suppliers of multinational companies including – at that time – Bosch, Continental, Hella, Magna, Visteon, Dutch State Mines (DSM), Dupont, and Walmart. We can add General Motors and Opel to the list. Now, two manufacturers have reimbursed over $2.5 million in total to migrant employees for fees paid to recruiters in Vietnam and Thailand. And the manufacturers stopped Taiwanese labor brokers from charging workers almost $1 million in annual service fees. Other forced labor indicators were addressed too. However, the remediation falls short of many multinationals’ policies. General Motors, Bosch, Hella, Continental, Walmart, and more commit to zero-fee recruitment and worker reimbursements, but the migrants were repaid 20 to 60 percent of their costs. And one year on, recruiters are still charging new workers fees for jobs at one of the Taiwanese manufacturers. What happened? Partial Reimbursements to Migrant Workers After landing at Taoyuan International Airport, it is just a short drive to the industrial areas surrounding it. Electronics, car parts, plastics, machinery, textile, and many other consumer goods are manufactured and exported worldwide from here. A major part of Taiwan’s migrant workforce stay in Taoyuan, so civil society groups are just around the corner too. Here, activists passionately explain about the need for proper protection of migrants and legal reforms. Workers in shelters indignantly tell stories of running away from factories and being in limbo because of Taiwan’s strict rules on job transfers, while debts increase. Workers’ stories differ, but circle around common themes of hardships from arrival and sky-rocketing debts from paying recruiters for jobs. None of the workers we met expected an easy life in Taiwan. They had no illusions. But most of our interviewees said they did not truly understand until days became weeks, and weeks became months, how they couldn’t just leave. Once the debt trap snaps and you are in a bad place, it’s not easy to get out. It doesn’t help that Taiwanese law makes it virtually impossible to change jobs, unless an employer approves. This is why progressive companies ensure that workers throughout their supply chain are not charged fees for jobs. For a decade, Bosch and Hella have imported car electronics from Chin Poon Industrial (CPI), whose motherboards appear in many of the world’s biggest car brands. It also supplies General Motors and Opel (both via Bosch), Magna, Visteon, and Continental. Continental has also imported for over a decade from the plastics maker Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation (SSFC), which also supplies Niagara Bottling, which makes billions of water bottles from SSFC’s plastics for customers such as Walmart. Until the end of 2022, DSM and Dupont also sourced from SSFC. All of these companies – except Opel, Magna, and Visteon – told The Diplomat that they commit to zero-fee recruitment, though we revealed in 2022 that some workers incurred heavy debts to pay recruiters anyway. Despite years of imports, none of the buyers said they had previously checked for debt bondage risks such as high recruitment fees. Following our report, several buyers addressed the problems with their Taiwanese supplier. Audits were conducted at both manufacturers – CPI and SSFC – to verify what workers told us; the German audit firm TÜV Rheinland did two audits at the electronics maker CPI, while the plastics maker SSFC had at least two audit firms visit. Then followed remediation. The two Taiwanese manufacturers agreed to practice zero-fee recruitment from December 2022. Later, they also agreed to reimburse employees for fees paid to recruiters abroad. And by January 2023, migrant workers at both companies were not charged monthly fees by Taiwanese labor brokers anymore, equaling two months of base wage per three-year contract, or almost $1 million per year for the two companies’ migrant workforces. The reimbursement processes ended in spring 2023. By March, the electronics maker CPI had reimbursed its migrant employees a flat rate based on nationalities, irrespective of what workers actually paid. The reimbursement was $2,100 to Vietnamese and $1,250 to Thai and Filipino workers, said CPI. By April, the plastics maker SSFC ended its reimbursement process. Migrant employees were reimbursed amounts based on their official affidavits, which for its Vietnamese workers amounted to between $2,400-$4,000 per affidavit, said SSFC. Workers at both manufacturers confirmed the reimbursement amounts. Some sent us photos of bank books and signed documents. In June, CPI told us that it would reimburse workers who resigned up to three months prior to its reimbursement process began. None of our 25 Vietnamese interviewees throughout 2022-23 said that they had expected refunds for their fees. Almost all borrowed large amounts to pay the recruiters. Some mortgaged family houses or land; some were still heavily indebted at the time of interview. They paid $3,700 to $6,500 or more in total recruitment fees per contract, while most paid an extra $500-$1,000 deposit, which is lost if they don’t complete the contract period. Several workers at both manufacturers were charged twice or more by recruiters for multiple contracts over the years. Some paid over $10,000 in total. “The money helped me repay part of my loan to pay the recruiter,” said a SSFC worker. “I was surprised. I never imagined getting my money back, although it is far from my total fees,” said another worker from CPI. When Company Policy and Practice Differ None of our interviewees was reimbursed in full. CPI – the electronics supplier of Bosch, Hella, Continental, Opel, General Motors and more – reimbursed down to 20 percent of some workers’ costs. SSFC – the plastics supplier of Walmart, Continental and Niagara Bottling – reimbursed around 60 percent of costs. “My agreement says $4,000, so I was reimbursed $4,000. But I paid $6,400. I know I was deceived by the recruiter,” said a SSFC worker. Several of his colleagues spoke about how Vietnamese recruiters had instructed them to state a total amount on video recordings – a legal amount – much lower than what they actually paid recruiters. The practice continued for years until late 2022. All our interviewees, who were recruited from abroad, said they paid recruiters much more than they officially signed. Recent audits confirm the picture, according to sources requesting anonymity. Some workers took courage to inform management during the reimbursement processes, but to no avail, as workers were not involved as anything but passive recipients. Why aren’t workers reimbursed properly, when multinational buyers commit to such reimbursements? Not one buyer admitted that workers weren’t fully reimbursed. The manufacturers were more transparent. Workers at the car electronics maker CPI received a flat rate based on nationality, no matter how much they paid or how many contracts they had paid for. CPI said that “the same nationality is reimbursed the same amount, this is fair and equal for all foreign workers from the respective countries. Otherwise, any discrepancy between them in the same country is expected to cause more issues among them.” Flat-rate reimbursements go against most ethical recruitment guidelines, including the standards of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an industry coalition with years of experience in Taiwan, which several of the companies referred to in replies to us. Workers should be repaid their actual costs. Hella, a long-term customer of CPI, said that “recruitment fees for which there is written evidence (such as the original contracts of migrant workers) and which cover documented fees paid to Taiwanese labor brokers … were reimbursed.” The statement contrasts with the fact that many workers signed multiple contracts and were charged for each one, but received the same as workers with just one contract. Hella did not reply our requests for clarification. Regardless, RBA standards do not require written evidence. Bosch, another long-term customer, claimed that “CPI complies with RBA standards.” Opel, a subsidiary of Stellantis, said that “Opel and Stellantis are in full support and alignment with the RBA standards” and repeated what Bosch had told The Diplomat about CPI. However, CPI told The Diplomat that it did not claim to have reached RBA’s standards on fee reimbursements, nor did it claim that workers had been fully reimbursed. Will it help now that General Motors (GM) has joined the table? GM wasn’t made aware of the issue until February 2023, when CPI’s reimbursement process had almost ended. GM told us that it “immediately engaged the suppliers and are working towards a resolution … As members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we utilize their tools, expertise and methodologies to convene stakeholders to develop verifiable resolutions to human rights issues.” GM’s supplier code of conduct is clear that “suppliers will provide full reimbursement to job seekers and workers if they have been required to pay any such fees or related costs.” The plastics maker SSFC took more responsibility. It reimbursed workers an individual amount for each contract where recruitment fees were paid, based on officially signed affidavits. Interviewees who had signed two contracts, and paid recruiters twice, confirmed to The Diplomat that they were repaid for each contract. However, officially signed documents do not mention fees above legal limits, and SSFC was clear to us that only legal fees were reimbursed. “SSFC’s zero-payment policy means that SSFC will pay for the fees that are charged legally in the worker’s home country as listed in the worker’s Wage Agreement. The local recruitment agencies in Vietnam and Thailand have been duly informed by Chi-Jian [SSFC’s labor broker subsidiary] that no such fees shall be charged to the workers,” said SSFC. Are companies inviting recruiters to keep charging illicit fees to workers by not addressing them? Closing your eyes doesn’t make the problem go away. In the first half of 2023, Vietnamese recruiters kept charging workers for jobs at SSFC, said workers. Several, but not all, recruits from Vietnam paid up to $700-1,000 under the table in spite of SSFC’s newly adopted zero-fee policy. Workers were told by two of SSFC’s recruitment partners in Vietnam that the fees covered paperwork and did not get receipts. SSFC replied to The Diplomat that none of its new recruits had mentioned paying any fees during onboarding interviews throughout 2023. The flat-rate $2,100 payouts to CPI’s Vietnamese workers amounts to around half of even just the legal fee limits when many of them were recruited. CPI stressed to The Diplomat that its zero-fee policy for new recruits from 2023 complies with RBA, after it had had the auditor TÜV Rheinland “find out the discrepancy between RBA’s rules and our practices.” From interviewing workers, we did not find reason to believe that new recruits continue paying fees in 2023. Workers Lack Faith in Corporate Grievance Mechanisms Although CPI and SSFC rejected further reimbursements, it is not uncommon for manufacturers in Taiwan to fully reimburse employees for recruitment fees and related costs when zero-fee policies are adopted, said RBA based on its longstanding experience in Taiwan. Auditors with years of work in Taiwan and Vietnam – who did not wish to be named because of the risks of losing clients – concurred. Buyers rarely chip in to make workers whole. Bosch said that “we can only refer to the opportunity to submit a compliance report in case your sources see still e.g. violations of social standards or human rights in the supply chain” and linked to its online complaint mechanism, open 24-7 and available in 15 languages (though not Vietnamese). When we passed the message on to workers at CPI, they asked us in return: “Why would Bosch listen to us there, if it doesn’t listen to us now?” Hella suggested that “workers at CPI can leverage a complaint system at CPI to submit their questions if there are open points.” But interviewees said that CPI did not listen to their colleagues who spoke up, and that they themselves did not want to risk trouble by complaining. “Grievance systems created as a top-down approach are mostly exclusionary of workers and do not engender the trust, engagement, and legitimacy that is required for workers to believe in and use these processes,” said Archana Kotecha, human rights lawyer and CEO of The Remedy Project, a social enterprise addressing migrant worker remediation in Southeast Asia. “When workers do engage with these processes, the outcome is often poor and not reflecting the harm suffered by workers.” Or, in the words of the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, “a grievance mechanism can only serve its purpose if the people it is intended to serve know about it, trust it, and are able to use it.” Prevention Is Key Avoiding debt bondage altogether requires proper prevention, not just remediation after the damage is done. Preventive measures should include – according to due diligence experts – that buyers expressly and verifiably require suppliers to pay for recruitment of workers, instead of merely stating in policies that workers should not pay for jobs. Many multinationals sourced from the two suppliers for years without expressly requiring them to cover workers’ fees until we raised the flag, and they continue sourcing despite the fact the meager 20 to 60 percent reimbursements amounts contrast with the buyers’ own policies. Nor did some of the world’s biggest investors, including the American giants BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA, and Norway’s State Pension Fund, who are top shareholders of one or both the suppliers, address debt bondage and other forced labor risks until now. There is not much prevention taking place here. But is momentum gathering? Multinational buyers are increasingly aware of debt bondage risks in Taiwan due to pressure from legislation in countries like the United States, Germany, France, and elsewhere. There is no shortage of research into the pitfalls of tick-box audit approaches and top-down supply chain policing and the promises of properly involving workers and defenders in due diligence approaches. International civil society groups are mapping Taiwanese supply chains. Taiwanese civil society groups continuously campaign for the government to abolish labor broker fees and allow migrants the freedom to change employers. Scholars address the need to reform Taiwan’s labor laws to better prevent forced labor. As the latest of the growing list of efforts addressing this issue in Taiwan, the United States signed a trade agreement in June with Taiwan, its 10th biggest supplier, from which it imported goods and services worth $105 billion last year. As part of the deal, both parties committed “to eliminate the charging of recruitment fees and related costs to migrant workers.”",https://thediplomat.com/2023/08/debt-bondage-payouts-mark-progress-but-fail-to-make-migrant-workers-whole-in-taiwan/,https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2023-08-22-121650.jpg,2023-08-22 18:28:54,Peter Bengtsen,en,us,-0.51
140370675,"Fear of coups: AU suspends Gabon as Cameroon, Rwanda retire generals, 1,000 soldiers","The African Union’s Peace and Security Council on Thursday suspended Gabon following the Wednesday overthrow of President Ondimba Ali Bongo by soldiers led by the head of the Republican guards, Gen Brice Nguema. The continental body in a post on X, formerly Twitter, condemned the military takeover of power in the Central African country. This came as Rwanda and Cameroon hurriedly retired 1, 029 senior officers in a surprise move against their respective militaries. The Rwandan authorities approved the retirement of 12 generals, including two four-star generals, James Kabarebe and Fred Ibingira, two three-star generals, Charles Kayonga and Frank Mushyo Kamanzi, and several officers. According to a Rwandan national newspaper, News Times, the government approved the retirement of 12 generals and many officers. The publication stated that the retirements were announced on Wednesday, in a statement issued by Rwanda Defence Force. Among those retired are two four-star generals, James Kabarebe and Fred Ibingira, two three-star generals, Charles Kayonga and Frank Mushyo Kamanzi. Kabarebe and Kayonga have previously served as Chief of Defence Staff of RDF, while the other two have been service chiefs previously The statement partly reads, “The President has also approved the retirement of 83 senior officers, six junior officers and 86 senior non-commissioned officers, 678 whose contracts ended and 160 medical discharges.” In Cameroon, President Paul Biya has also reshuffled the military with new appointments to the Controle Generale des Armees. The new controllers are Capt Ajeagah Njei Félix Colonel and Colonel Nguema Ondo Bertin Bourger. Appointments were also made to the positions of Technical Advisers, Bureau Commissariat, and Air Force Technical Inspector. Disclosing its decision after a meeting of its Peace and Security Council, the AU said it “decides to immediately suspend the participation of Gabon in all activities of the AU, its organs and institutions.” It said the meeting was chaired by the AU commissioner for political affairs, Bankole Adeoye of Nigeria, and the current holder of the council’s rotating chair, Burundi’s Willy Nyamitwe. Nguema for inauguration In a new development, the junta in Gabon has said Gen Nguema will be sworn in on Monday as the transitional president as the opposition called for its candidate to be recognised as the winner of weekend elections. The military in a statement on Thursday sought to reassure international donors they would “respect all commitments” at home and abroad and “phase in” transitional institutions. The spokesman for the new regime, Col Ulrich Manfoumbi, said on state television that the swearing-in of Nguema would take place at the constitutional court. Gabon’s opposition Alternance 2023 alliance had remained silent since the coup, but on Thursday called on the military leaders to acknowledge its victory in the election. The alliance “invited the defence and security forces to the discussion so as to work out the best solution,” following the vote. Led by university professor Albert Ondo Ossa, Alternance had earlier accused President Ali Bongo of “fraud” and demanded he hand over power “without bloodshed”. Ossa claimed the Bongo clan remained in control and there had not been a coup but a “palace revolution”. “Oligui Nguema is Ali Bongo’s cousin,” he told France’s TV5 Monde. He stated, “The Bongos found that Ali Bongo had to be put aside to be able to properly pursue the Bongo system. Oligui Nguema is an underling. Behind him, it’s the Bongo clan keeping hold of power,” he said, urging international help to restore order. Meanwhile, a serious humanitarian crisis is looming in Niger Republic as the vulnerable population, particularly, women and children, are facing hunger and other hardships in the aftermath of the sanctions imposed on the country by the Economic Community of West African States over the July 26 overthrow of President Mohamed Bazoum by the military. This came to light as the Niger junta ordered the police to forcefully evict the French ambassador, Sylvain Itte, from the country. Niger’s foreign ministry announced that Itte had 48 hours to leave, saying he had refused to meet with the new rulers and citing French government actions that were “contrary to the interests of Niger.” The visas of the French ambassador to Niamey, Sylvain Itte, and his family had been cancelled and police were instructed to expel the envoy, the junta said in a statement dated Aug. 29 and confirmed as authentic on Thursday by its communications head, according to Reuters. The latest communique sent by Niger’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Itte “no longer enjoys the privileges and immunities attached to his status as a member of the diplomatic staff of the embassy. The police have been instructed to carry out his expulsion.” Humanitarian crisis That said, the closure of the borders of Nigeria and other neighbouring countries has starved the francophone nation of food and other critical supplies, putting the beleaguered country on the edge of a humanitarian crisis. To compel the junta led by Gen Tchiani Abdourahmane to restore the ousted president to power, the 15-member regional bloc imposed stringent sanctions on the Sahel nation and also threatened military intervention to restore constitutional order. It suspended all commercial transactions with Niger, froze its assets in the regional central bank, including the assets of the state and state enterprises in commercial banks, and suspended all financial assistance with regional development banks. A planned $51m bond issuance by Niger in the West African regional debt market was cancelled by the regional central bank following the imposition of sanctions. Niger had planned to raise $834 million from the regional debt market in 2023. Nigeria also cut the power supply to the country on the 80mw Birnin-Kebbi line, while Ivory Coast suspended imports and exports of Nigerien goods. West Africa’s regional central bank, the BCEAO, shut down its branches in Niger, citing risks to operations. However, the Niger Country Director of the International Rescue Committee, Paolo Cernuschi, said these decisions were having disastrous humanitarian impacts on the most economically vulnerable people in the Niger Republic. He disclosed in an opinion published by Euronews on Thursday that aid organisations cannot get critical supplies into the country. The border closures, he noted, had further compounded the political crisis, preventing life-saving humanitarian supplies and essential aid from reaching the communities that needed them most, creating a barrier that separates people from the assistance they require to survive. Cernuschi explained, “We have en route shipments of life-saving nutritional supplements for 2,300 children that we don’t know when we’ll receive. While we have contingency stocks in place, those will eventually run out. “If border closures and sanctions persist, aid supplies running out will be all but a certainty, and the capacity of humanitarian actors to continue delivering will be jeopardised. “By some estimates, supplies in the country at the time of the coup were sufficient for two to three months of humanitarian response. With supply chains requiring from a few weeks to a couple of months to replenish stocks, we are fast approaching the point where shortages will be inevitable.” The country director said the sanctions had unintended adverse impacts on the lives of ordinary citizens who are already struggling to meet their basic needs. He advised that humanitarian exemptions must be guaranteed to ensure continuity of humanitarian work in Niger. He advised that “The international community and regional organisations must prioritise a ‘do no harm’ approach in dealing with this situation. Diplomatic efforts should focus on finding peaceful solutions that prioritise the well-being of all Nigerien citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status. “The situation in Niger calls for a coordinated and compassionate response that upholds the principles of humanitarianism and ensures that no one is left behind. And the Nigerien people deserve that and a whole lot more.” In response to the situation, the United Nations on Tuesday filed an exemption request for relief supplies to the Niger Republic to the ECOWAS. The global organisation said sanctions on Niger were blocking vital humanitarian aid such as food and medicine. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees representative for Niger, Emmanuel Gignac, stated this at a press briefing during a visit to Geneva. Reuters reported that trucks with food and humanitarian aid have been piling up at Niger’s land borders since the military coup on July 26, driving up food prices, in a sign of the impact of the sanctions. Gignac noted, “There is no way to bring humanitarian aid into the country. The immediate goods (affected) are going to be food and then it’s going to be access to medicine, to drugs.” He added that a formal letter from UN aid chief Martin Griffiths had been addressed to ECOWAS for exemptions. UN aid flights have also been reportedly grounded because they cannot get access to jet fuel because of the sanctions, complicating aid efforts in the country. Food aid Some agencies are using trucks, said World Food Programme regional spokesperson, Djaounsede Madjiangar, but that takes extra time. Requests for special ECOWAS clearance for aid supplies have so far not been granted, he added. A UNICEF spokesperson had told Reuters that the agency has about 50 containers with immunization, cold chain equipment, and therapeutic food stuck at different entry points, unable to get into the country, while more than a million doses of yellow fever and rotavirus vaccines cannot be flown in from Europe due to the airspace closure. He added the agency was concerned about some 28 million vaccine doses stocked inside the country, with 95 percent of warehouses currently hit by power outages. Gignac also voiced concerns about the security of Niger’s population, especially among its 700,000 forcibly displaced people, describing a sharp increase in protection incidents such as kidnapping and sexual violence since the coup. The World Food Programme said the political development in the country has made the hunger crisis critical. The acting WFP Regional Director for Western Africa, Margot van der Velden, in an editorial on the agency’s website stressed the imperative of getting aid to Niger’s vulnerable population. “Our work is vital for the most vulnerable in Niger and needs to continue, particularly in the current circumstances. Whatever the political situation, continuing our humanitarian and resilience efforts is crucial at these times of crisis,” she added. In the first week of August alone, WFP said its teams delivered life-saving food to 140,000 people across the country and vital malnutrition care to 74,000 children. As concerns about the humanitarian situation mount, Nigerians residing in Niger have called on the Federal Government to resolve ECOWAS’ differences with the embattled country. Ibrahim Afolabi, who spoke with our correspondent from Taawa, said that most Nigerians living in Niger Republic were apprehensive about the situation. He said, “Although we cannot sleep with our two eyes closed, honestly, there is no form of harassment against us. The only problem we have now is the high cost of living compared to before the closure of borders at both ends. “ECOWAS needs to soft-pedal on this issue; the majority of the people of Niger Republic here support the military junta and their style in the country, so why not ECOWAS look at that aspect and resolve this issue?” Abubakar Namazo, who resides in Algadez, said the major problem they faced in Niger Republic is the high cost of foodstuffs and other items. He said, “I think it’s better for the Federal Government of Nigeria to extend their palliatives to our side as well. Business has gone bad here since the two countries of Niger Republic and Nigerians close their borders.’’ In a bid to survive, motorists now ply illegal routes through Illela on the Nigerian side to beat the closure of the borders. Mr Samaila Abdul, a motorcycle operator, explained that security operatives extorted motorists and motorcycle operators who plied the illegal bush route. “We now use the bush (route) to get across to the other country from Nigeria. So, the expenses have been added to the cost of foodstuffs, especially those items we take to them from Nigeria and the one we buy over there (in Niger),’’ he revealed. Meanwhile, President Bola Tinubu on Thursday said all diplomatic options will be exhausted with the military junta in Niger Republic before a resort to military intervention comes into the picture. He insisted that any forceful removal of a democratic government remains “wholly unacceptable,” a statement by the State House said. Receiving the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III, at the State House, Tinubu noted that the alternative of kinetic intervention in Niger Republic had not been jettisoned. “I must thank you for your several visits to Niger Republic, Your Eminence, but you will still have to go back. My fear has been confirmed in Gabon that copycats will start doing the same thing until it is stopped. ‘’We are neighbours with the Niger Republic, and what has joined Nigerians together with their great people cannot be broken. Nobody is interested in a war. We have seen the devastation in Ukraine and Sudan. But if we don’t wield the big stick, we will all suffer the consequences together,” the President warned. He noted that Nigeria under General Abdulsalami Abubakar instituted a nine-month transition programme in 1998, and it proved very successful, leading the country into a new era of democratic governance. The President sees no reason why such cannot be replicated in Niger if the junta was sincere. “Your Eminence, please don’t get tired, you will still go back there. The soldiers’ action is unacceptable. The earlier they make positive adjustments, the quicker we will dial back the sanctions to alleviate the sufferings we are seeing in Niger,” the President affirmed. On the hardship faced by many Nigerians post-fuel subsidy removal, the President assured that all ongoing reforms will liberate and reposition the economy, which will benefit the majority of the population in terms of opportunities, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. “Nigeria is headed for a promise. Our diversity will turn into prosperity, not adversity. We will build a country that our children will be proud of,” the President assured. The President told the delegation that the Federal Government had opened talks with state governments to provide land for the proper sustenance of animals with a view to developing pan-national animal husbandry and agro-allied production and processing facilities for mass export, job creation, and revenue generation. He noted, “If Nigeria is still looking for vaccines for basic health issues; if infant and maternal mortality is rampant, then we should examine ourselves. I will commit to consulting with other leaders, like the NSCIA, and we will meet the needs of our people.” In his contribution, Vice President Kashim Shettima said the President had budgeted N50 billion to support the ongoing rebuilding of lives and property in the North West and North East, with a new focus on dialogue to address security challenges. The Sultan of Sokoto pledged “one hundred percent loyalty” to the President, affirming that a leader can only reach a position by the will of God, and not man. The monarch assured the President that the NSCIA would be available to advise and support him to realize his dream for the country, adding that “God will hold all leaders to account, in justice and fairness.” Meanwhile, trans-border traders have said that so far over 250 trucks carrying different perishable goods including, onion, pineapples, and tomatoes worth N2bn have been trapped. The Head of Policy and Research of the Transborder Traders Association, Alhjai Salami Nasiru, said this in a telephone conversation with the PUNCH on Thursday.",https://punchng.com/fear-of-coups-au-suspends-gabon-as-cameroon-rwanda-retire-generals-1000-soldiers/,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/31004916/Gabon.jpg,2023-09-01 01:11:55,Deborah Tolu,en,ng,0.113
140384865,Govt enforcing fair conditions for supermarket suppliers - Duncan Webb,"New supply code prohibits abuse of power by supermarkets over suppliers Supermarket duopoly must pay on time and treat suppliers fairly Penalties include the greater of 3% of turnover or $3 million for breaches of new code Grocery Commission to act as watchdog to enforce new rules Big supermarket chains face stiff fines for not treating small suppliers fairly, thanks to the Labour Government’s new Grocery Code of Conduct , says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Duncan Webb. ""The big supermarket chains have not been treating local suppliers fairly - they have been taking advantage of their dominance and imposing unreasonable terms and conditions. We are calling time on their poor behaviour,"" Duncan Webb said in launching the code in Christchurch today. ""The new code requires large corporates to do things like pay on time, have plain-English supply contracts and deal with small companies in good faith. ""It’s entirely reasonable and hardly too much to ask. Local suppliers have been stretched for a long time, and that’s stifled innovation and the development of our food supply chain. ""Establishing this Grocery Code of Conduct is another critical step in the Government’s reform of the grocery sector to make it fair for consumers and suppliers."" Agreed to this week, the code will initially apply to the two big supermarket chains, Woolworths New Zealand (including the Countdown Brand) and Foodstuffs North Island and South Island (including Pak ‘n Save, New World and Four Square). The maximum penalty for companies breaching the code is the greater of 3 per cent of turnover, the value of any commercial gain from the breach, or $3 million. Individuals face fines up to $200,000. The code comes into force on 28 September and will be monitored and enforced by new Grocery Commissioner Pierre van Heerden, whose position was established in July.",http://www.voxy.co.nz/politics/5/421287,http://www.voxy.co.nz/files/pictures/picture-5.png,2023-09-01 02:30:56,Fuseworks Media,en,nz,-0.264
138452099,AMD Showcases How Innovation and Partnerships Advance,"SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today released its annual Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report, detailing progress toward goals spanning environmental sustainability; digital impact; supply chain responsibility; and diversity, belonging and inclusion. For 28 years AMD has reported on its CR programs and initiatives, and this is the company’s first report incorporating environmental and social data from recent acquisitions. “At AMD, Corporate Responsibility is an integral part of our business strategy, culture and the relationships we foster with our customers and partners,” said Susan Moore, corporate vice president of Corporate Responsibility and International Government Affairs at AMD and president of the AMD Foundation. “Together with our employees, partners and customers, we are focused on responsibly designing and delivering high-performance and adaptive computing solutions for a more connected, sustainable and inclusive world.” AMD conducted a new environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality assessment1 in 2023 to determine its most important issues in corporate responsibility based on their potential impact on the business and the potential impact the business has on society and the environment, known as “double materiality.” The assessment reaffirmed existing focus areas, including topics such as product energy efficiency; diversity, belonging and inclusion; responsible sourcing; and human rights in the supply chain. Responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and product use emerged as new issues with high impact on both AMD and society. AI is an immense opportunity that comes with unique challenges, and AMD is committed to working with the industry to innovate and deploy AI for good while reducing risks. Key highlights from this year’s report include: Accelerating sustainable computing: Semiconductors have an important role to play in the global response to the climate crisis, powering critical research and enabling more energy-efficient devices. As the demand for compute-intensive workloads like AI and high performance computing (HPC) accelerates, processor energy consumption is of critical importance. AMD prioritizes innovations that improve both performance and environmental sustainability through its goal to deliver 30x energy efficiency improvement in processors and accelerators for AI-training and HPC by 2025.2 For 2023, AMD is on track toward achieving 13.5x improvement from the 2020 base year using a configuration of four AMD Instinct™ MI300A APUs launching later this year.3 Addressing greenhouse gas emissions: AMD also aims to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its operations and collaborating with direct manufacturing suppliers and customers. In 2022, AMD achieved a 19% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to 2020.4 Aligned with AMD goals, 70% of the company’s direct manufacturing suppliers5 have public greenhouse gas emissions targets and 68% sourced renewable energy in 2022.6 AMD was again recognized as a CDP Supplier Engagement Leader for related goals and governance, landing in the top 8% of respondents. Partnering across the value chain: AMD works with suppliers, partners and peers to address environmental sustainability and human rights issues across the semiconductor value chain as a founding member of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium and Responsible Business Alliance’s Senior Environmental Advisory Taskforce. In 2023, AMD also completed its first Human Rights Saliency Assessment to enhance its human rights strategy. Advancing representation and STEM education: AMD wants to go beyond representation to lead the fabless semiconductor industry in inclusion and developing underrepresented talent such as women in engineering roles. Importantly, retention of female engineers remains strong at the company, and 92% of global employees say AMD creates an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed. AMD is also passionate about enabling the next generation of innovators and continues to invest in STEM education through partnerships with universities, K-12 educators and nonprofit organizations. AMD prepared the 2022-23 Corporate Responsibility Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021).

The adoption of this technology is notably favored by automakers, drawn to its potential to enhance the driving experience. As technological maturity converges with cost reduction, HUD technology is making its presence felt even in affordable vehicle models, hinting at a future where it becomes a standard feature in smart cars. A case in point is the Changan Deepal S7, introduced in early March 2023, where the conventional dashboard is replaced by a 53-inch holographic AR-HUD system, a transformation made possible by Zhejiang Crystal-Optech, the AR-HUD supplier. Within the intricate AR-HUD industry chain, various components seamlessly come together, including picture generation units (PGU), optical mirrors, glass, and software. At the upstream end, the PGU holds paramount importance, accounting for a significant 50% of the total HUD cost, closely followed by the optical mirror with a 20% share. The cost-efficiency achieved by these pivotal components has set the stage for a rapid evolution of AR-HUD implementation, igniting progress at an exceptional pace. The resulting swift advancement in technologies tied to these components has been the hallmark of recent years, signifying the dynamic nature of the automotive technology landscape. Emerging projection technologies such as LCoS and LBS are capturing market shares. PGU is used to generate pictures and control brightness. At present, the most mature PGU technology path for AR HUD is DLP, a high-cost technology monopolized by TI. Yet Chinese suppliers conduct in-depth research on emerging projection technologies like LCoS and LBS, aiming to seize the initiative and overtake on the bend. LCoS technology uses the LCoS panel to modulate the optical signal emitted by the light source and projected to the screen, but the light emitted will not penetrate the reflective LCoS panel. LCoS offers the following benefits: 1. High light use efficiency, up to 40% or higher; 2. High resolution, up to 4k or even 8k, and wide color gamut; 3. Low cost after the process matures. In September 2021, Huawei introduced its AR-HUD product, and in April 2023, Huawei released the xHUD AR-HUD. Both products use LCoS projection technology and feature small size and large format. HUAWEI xHUD AR-HUD can display a 70-inch image at a distance of 7.5 meters, and a 96-inch image at 10 meters. This product can support such applications as intelligent driving visualization, lane-level navigation, reversing camera, Digital Elf, and giant screen viewing. LBS, a laser scanning and projection technology, uses lasers as the light source, and realizes projection via a MEMS micro-mirror. It offers the following benefits: 1. Greatly simplified optical engine, and small size; 2. High contrast, easily up to 7000:1; 3. High brightness and wide color gamut (>150%); 4. Low power consumption (< 4-6W), and low heat generation. Nevertheless, for the temperature-sensitive laser diodes fall short of the working requirements of 85C, LBS has yet to be mature enough to be applied. Founded in 2021, LM Jade Chip Technology is a Chinese company engaged in development and industrial application of MEMS chips and laser scanning micro-display modules. For AR-HUD, it has developed a complete LBS-based solution LM-PGU-1000 and provided to its partners such as Sunny Optical Technology, OFILM and Aptiv. LM-PGU-1000 has the following features: 1. A solution to display speckle, speckle contrast: < 4%; 2. Higher horizontal resolution and larger horizontal FOV; 3. Lower power consumption and higher brightness; 4. Higher contrast. Waveguide technology will become the ultimate optical display solution. Too large installation size and fairly high cost of AR HUD are currently the sore points for the industry. The waveguide technology allows for removal of the mechanical and optical mechanisms inside conventional HUDs, which means the first two reflections are omitted so that the information from the light source is directly projected onto the windshield. AR HUD occupies space one tenth of conventional mechanical solutions. In addition, the optical waveguide solution delivers high light transmittance, large FOV, and good display effect. Optical waveguide falls into geometric optical waveguide and diffractive optical waveguide. Wherein, the diffractive optical waveguide technology is the key development direction of AR-HUD, and is divided into surface relief grating waveguide and volume holographic grating waveguide. Surface relief grating waveguide, a mature technology often seen in AR near-eye display devices, provides thinness, large field of view, and large eye movement range. At present, it is a mainstream optical waveguide solution for AR-HUD, and manufacturers such as Suzhou SVG Tech Group and Greatar Tech are all making layout of it. With independent R&D of 3D lithography equipment as the core driver, Suzhou SVG Tech Group works on research and industrialization of optoelectronic materials and devices for the fields of information photonics and new displays. In June 2021, the joint-stock private company announced a large-format optical waveguide module for AR-HUD. This module offers the display effects of ultra-thinness, large field of view, and long virtual image viewing distance. Based on the self-developed micro-nano lithography equipment and platform, this module can process about 2×1011 nanometer units on the 20cmx20cm waveguide surface, and provide a projection distance longer than 15 meters. Currently this module has been used in AR-HUD and installed in Huawei’s intelligent driving system. The volume holographic grating waveguide can reduce the volume of AR-HUD to one fifth to one tenth of the conventional geometric optics ones. Compared with reflector-type AR-HUD with a volume of 22L, the holographic optical waveguide enables a volume of only 2.4L; the main imaging module can also standardized and mass-produced at low cost. Such AR-HUD is promising. However the production process is complicated, and currently few manufacturers have the ability to produce in quantities. It is in 2023 that the application of corresponding AR-HUD products will start. Tripole Optoelectronics began to deploy volume holographic diffractive optical waveguide technology in 2019. In June 2021, Tripole Optoelectronics worked with BAIC and TCL CSOT to promote holographic optical waveguide AR-HUD. In January 2022, the company built a holographic diffractive optical device production line with the annual capacity of millions of holographic diffractive elements, providing large-area holographic optical waveguide AR-HUD products for manufacturers in automotive industry.

141509285,Yum China Inaugurates China’s First 100% Renewable Energy Cold Chain Logistics Center,"SHANGHAI, September 5, 2023 /3BL/ - Yum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: YUMC and HKEX: 9987, ""Yum China"" or the ""Company"") has unveiled a landmark accomplishment in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As of July 2023, its company-owned logistics center in Nanning, Guangxi province is completely powered by renewable energy. Based on the Company’s market assessment, Yum China’s Nanning logistics center stands out as the first cold chain logistics center in China to fully operate on carbon-neutral power. This achievement aligns with the Company’s objective to achieve net-zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050. Furthermore, this shift to green energy operation was achieved without increasing utility costs, further cementing Yum China’s leadership in GHG emissions reduction within the restaurant industry in China. ""The inauguration of our fully green-powered logistics center in Nanning marks a significant milestone in Yum China's sustainability journey,” said Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China. “It's a meaningful achievement that emphasizes our responsibility to our planet and showcases what's possible for the future of our industry."" This milestone complements Yum China’s ongoing renewable energy transition efforts in its restaurants and supporting facilities. By the end of 2023, Yum China is estimated to have a total annual green power consumption of about 10 million kWh, encompassing logistics centers and restaurants within the Company’s operational control. Roughly 70 stores in Zhejiang, Anhui and Shanxi provinces are expected to complete a full transition to green energy in the fourth quarter of 2023. Utilizing a diverse range of green power trading models, Yum China is accelerating renewable energy adoption across its restaurants nationwide. To meet increasing demands for renewable energy in the years to come, Yum China plans to generate its own power from distributed photovoltaics (DPV) while supplementing with green power purchases. By 2025, all newly-built Yum China logistics centers are expected to use solar power generated from rooftop DPVs. Plans are currently underway to install DPVs in the Company’s Nanning (Guangxi) logistics center and in its upcoming Nanxiang (Shanghai) logistics center. As in-house green energy production capability increases, Yum China is bolstering its energy storage capacity to optimize utilization. The Company also has been driving low-carbon transformation across its entire value chain through the launch of a Distributed Photovoltaic and Virtual Green Power Purchase Alliance with 40 key suppliers in May 2023. These efforts collectively illustrate Yum China’s steadfast approach to explore and invest in affordable, reliable, and scalable renewable energy opportunities to support its ongoing low-carbon transition.

143160625,Looking to buy sustainable spices? You might need to research more to know where exactly your spices hail from,"When the veteran Indian food critic Marryam H. Reshii decided to write a book about spices, she hoped to encourage people to think a little more deeply about the contents of their spice rack or masala dabba. ""Considering how all-important they are,"" Reshii says, she found that most people didn't know a lot about spices — ""where they grow, how widespread their use is, what makes the spice in a particular region better (or not) than its counterparts."" But in researching 2017's ""The Flavour of Spice,"" Reshii encountered some details even she wasn't expecting. Though the country is often cited as the largest spice producer in the world, ""India was rather late to the party,"" Reshii says. ""Black pepper, turmeric and green cardamom are almost definitely native to India,"" she explains — but go back far enough and many of the other household spices, which India both consumes and exports in huge volumes, are not. Not only is the spice trade a global industry, it was also one of the first. That's how so many of the spices that are foundational to Indian cooking actually made their way there from somewhere else, Reshii explains — sometimes surprisingly recently, as with chiles, brought from Brazil by Portuguese colonizers just five centuries ago. The movement of these flavors has shaped cuisines the world over for thousands of years, and today, some analyses value the global spice market at more than $37 billion. In the U.S., per capita spice consumption has tripled since the 1960s and demand continues to grow in the wake of a pandemic-era spice boom. Still, with an entrenched (and often exploitative) global supply chain, direct, transparent, sustainable sourcing has only recently started to make headway A tangled supply chain The millennia-old spice trade was always extremely lucrative for those who controlled it, but it was the development of colonialism and capitalism that shaped spice supply chains as we know them today. A desire to get around the competition and find a shorter way to the sources of spice was what sent Columbus across the Atlantic, and soon after, drove the Portuguese to sail around the southern tip of Africa and build trading posts from Cape Verde to Mozambique to Goa to Malacca. The Dutch followed and then the English, both with their own East India Companies (considered some of the world's earliest corporations). Soon, the goal became to control the lands where the spices were grown and the people who lived there. In 2008's ""The Taste of Conquest,"" culinary historian Michael Krondl writes that a visit to the Rotterdam-based conglomerate Nedspice was a reminder of ""how little the spice business has changed."" He saw that the supply chain looked in many ways like it did centuries ago: Spices were predominantly grown by smallholder farmers, who sold to any number of middlemen, who sent the spices along to brokers or auction houses in larger towns and cities. From there, the products were sold — no longer to local merchants or colonial enterprises — but, instead, to international corporations, which imported and then distributed them to their own clients around the world. ""Perhaps the biggest change,"" Krondl writes, ""is that the transportation has been cut from the six or seven months it used to take in the seventeenth century to some two weeks today."" With commodity spices — the ones that are sold to companies interchangeably, rather than coming from a specific source — it remains a challenge to trace every person or company a product passes through, leaving room for things like poor labor practices to go unpenalized and making quality control difficult. (""Sitting around in warehouses with fluctuating ambient temperatures and humidity levels does not do spices any favors,"" Reshii notes.) The convoluted supply chain also means farmers are typically underpaid and sometimes caught in a cycle of debt. Because spices are grown in many regions and represent a broad category — encompassing flavorful seeds, bark, roots, flowers and dried fruits — specific products can have their own unique issues. For example, in light of the ongoing demand for turmeric in the U.S., fueled in part by the wellness industry and no small amount of appropriation, Undark recently reported on the prevalence of an additive called peuri (lead chromate) used by some farmers in South Asia to give their product the distinctive golden glow favored by buyers. Saffron, the world's most expensive spice, is a common target of food fraud. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor listed cloves from Tanzania, cumin from Turkey, pepper from Vietnam and vanilla from Madagascar and Uganda as goods for which evidence of child labor has been found. The environmental issues pervasive in industrial agriculture are not absent from the spice industry, either, even though spice farms can be relatively small in scale. Likewise, ""Climate change poses significant challenges for spice cultivation,"" says Jennifer Boggiss, co-founder and CEO of New Zealand- and Tonga-based Heilala Vanilla. ""Many spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and vanilla are native to specific regions with rich biodiversity,"" often in parts of the Global South that are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. In India, for example, warming temperatures have already been associated with cardamom blight in the state of Sikkim and decreases in yields of Kashmiri saffron. Building a better system ""We get companies that will email us to say, 'Hey, we've got turmeric. You want to buy it from us?'"" says Nareena Switlo, co-founder, with her mother, Umeeda, of the turmeric paste company Naledo. ""When we see the prices that they're offering, you think, 'There's no way anybody in your supply chain is living in anything but poverty.'"" In an industry in which ""the cheapest still wins,"" she says, this is hardly unusual. The Naledo story encapsulates the global reach of the spice industry: A Canadian company rooted in the Indian diaspora, its turmeric is grown and processed entirely in Belize, where the root had been introduced by indentured servants during the period of British colonial rule. While working in Belize as an advisor on youth and enterprise, CEO Umeeda Switlo saw that turmeric was now wild-harvested mostly in Mayan communities and grew abundantly without any intervention. Naledo pays them up to 7.5 times the fair trade price and has built a production facility to create value-added local work. ""If you wanted to know which farmer actually grew the turmeric in your bottle and when we bought it, we could tell you,"" Umeeda says. Within the past decade, reappraisal of antiquated supply chains has spurred the development of a new type of spice company. More businesses are sourcing directly from the people growing the spices and paying far higher than commodity prices, cutting out the many intermediaries that keep farmer incomes low and reduce the quality of the product. Turmeric was also the starting point for Diaspora Co., a notable early innovator that has since expanded to offer 30 different spices — sumac from Manipur, garlic from Uttarakhand — all grown on family-owned farms that follow a regenerative model. Other companies that have emerged in the past eight or so years include Burlap & Barrel and Curio Spice Co., which, like Diaspora Co., offer down payments to the farmers they work with so they don't have to wait for harvest time. Down the Road Spice Co. focuses on USDA certified organic masalas, while Zoe's Ghana Kitchen (founded by London chef Zoe Adjonyoh) works with Black African farmers growing spices like iru beans and grains of Selim. Several companies source Afghan saffron with an eye toward uplifting growers and communities economically, including Heray Spice, Rumi Spice, Tahmina and Moonflowers. In addition to the social enterprise aspect, direct sourcing provides an opportunity to implement more sustainable practices and work with growers to do the same. ""Maintaining healthy soil is crucial,"" says Boggiss, who notes that the Tongan family farmers from whom Heilala sources have recently planted windbreaks of Pacific kauri trees and vetiver grass to prevent soil erosion. The company also tries to minimize waste by using every part of the vanilla bean — not just the fragrant seeds — in its various products. ""Sustainable sourcing is gaining more focus,"" says Laura Shumow, executive director of the American Spice Trade Association (ASTA). ""In the past, sustainability has been a way for certain companies to differentiate themselves to a specific set of consumers, but we expect that in the future sustainability will become a baseline requirement for the entire industry."" Even McCormick & Co., the world's largest seasonings company, has announced much-publicized commitments to sustainability and economic resilience for farmers. Last year, ASTA signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sustainable Spices Initiative (SSI), a project that brings together companies and NGOs, which Shumow says ""is working against specific benchmarks"" for future production. The SSI also has local platforms in Vietnam and India with partners on the ground to help farmers implement more sustainable practices, like integrated pest management. Making local spices a reality Krissy Scommegna, owner of the California chile farm Boonville Barn Collective, first noticed the opacity around spices and the limits of local sourcing during her former career as a chef: The restaurant where she worked, in Mendocino County, used mostly produce grown on-site or purchased from farmers they knew, but the seasonings were an exception. ""I wondered what that would look like if we could do the same for some of our spices,"" she remembers. The menu at the time relied heavily on piment d'Espelette, a chile from the Basque Country of France, which Scommegna realized could grow well in Mendocino thanks to the similarities in climate. Her operation has since expanded, now growing 12 chile varieties that are turned into powder, dried whole or used for salsas and marmalades. A more sustainable, ethical spice trade might involve growing a more robust spice industry domestically. These ingredients have largely been left out of local food movements — and though many spices come from tropical plants that won't easily grow here, local seasonings are more within reach than many realize. Some companies are already sourcing from small spice farmers in the U.S.: Burlap & Barrel offers chiles and curry leaves from California, as does Curio, which also has California-grown fennel pollen and makrut lime leaves, New Mexico chiles and Massachusetts paprika. Farms from Texas to Vermont are now growing saffron; the South has a modest sesame-growing industry. Farmers in Hawaiʻi have already been experimenting with growing cloves, cinnamon, allspice and more. ""In terms of emissions, our chiles haven't traveled around the globe to get to our customers,"" Scommegna explains, and doing a lot of the production work by hand reduces emissions even further. She also cites other aspects of sustainable production, like labor protections and stable, long-term employment for workers, as being easier to guarantee with a more focused operation. And the local scale makes for a better product, she says: The September harvest will be processed and packaged by the beginning of November, never having traveled more than a quarter mile. Is 'single-origin' enough? As with other imported products, notably chocolate and coffee, you'll often see specialty spices labeled with the phrase ""single-origin."" Though this often indicates some intentionality around quality or traceability, Shumow identifies it as a marketing term more than a technical certification, noting that, while ""there seems to be a perception that this term is linked to more sustainable practices,"" she wasn't aware of any regulatory bodies that had explicitly defined the parameters. In general, ""single-origin"" means that the product in question was sourced from one place — though the scope of that place can vary. Sometimes, it means everything was sourced from the same growing region; in other cases, as with Diaspora Co., each spice comes from one independently owned farm. (The company has all partner farms plotted on a sourcing map, which links out to information about the individual farmers and ingredients.) Either way, these products represent a level of divestment from the commodity supply chain, in which spices of various ages, from various places, are typically mixed together. But it's important to remember that not all companies who fit the ""single-origin"" description will use the term. There are also other, more formalized labels that can help you buy better spices. The SSI has formalized a ""basket"" of approved standards, which includes Fair for Life, Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade certifications, though these are often better indicators of worker welfare than of environmental efforts (for example, none of the three prohibit synthetic fertilizers or sewage sludge). Some spice companies, including Naledo, Rumi and Heilala, are also registered as public benefit corporations, or B Corps. Organic certifications are common, too, but not every spice farmer can easily get their operation certified — it is often a costly process — even if they are essentially meeting the standards already. Boggiss cautions that, when shopping, ""it's essential to go beyond the label."" Research where the spices were produced; with vanilla, as with many other spices, ""some regions have better sustainability practices than others."" You can also look for companies that provide information about their business model, explain their sustainability framework, name the farmers or suppliers they work with, agree to regular third-party audits or issue annual impact reports. ""Transparency is key,"" Boggiss says — ""so choose brands willing to share details about their sourcing and production practices."" While you're at it, it's also worth reflecting on history and the unjust systems that have been created in the name of these flavors. ""To help dismantle that neocolonialist spice trade,"" Nareena Switlo advises, ""look for brands that are actually managed and owned and operated"" by the people impacted by those colonial structures.

140353055,Popular high street bakery that shut 170 stores set to reopen branches,"A high street bakery chain that closed 170 branches after collapsing into administration is to reopen some stores, it has been claimed. Patisserie Valerie once boasted 193 stores across Britain with close to 3,000 staff, and is now is set to relaunch restaurants in the autumn. The chain was forced to bring in administrators in 2019 amid the aftermath of accountancy fraud, culling 71 stores. Its stores currently number just 29, while eateries can only be found in cities and larger towns. However, it does have concessions in around 400 Sainsbury's stores selling cakes. Its remaining restaurants are found in London, as well across the South East and up north in York, Leeds, Chester and Durham. It reportedly plans to reopen two restaurants in the coming weeks. Its Cambridge branch will be once again open for business next week following a refurbishment, while its Cribbs Causeway site, near Bristol, will open in mid-October. More cafes are expected to open in the coming months - though locations and dates have not been confirmed, reports The Sun. The chain was so cash-strapped at one point it was forced to strip butter from its puff-pastry. Causeway Capital Partners - which bought the chain after its collapse in January 2019 - said it discovered broken ovens that had been untouched for months, unpaid suppliers and no health and safety procedures. Owner Matt Scaife said he was left stunned when he toured his acquisition's headquarters. He said the bakery roof was leaking and according to its books, firms hadn't been paid. Patisserie Valerie slid into administration amid a series of failings, sparked by an accounting scandal. At the time, a £100million black hole was discovered in its books, leading to the loss of 900 jobs. Scaife's firm Causeway Capital Partners bought the chain - once valued at £450million - for just £5million. However, after making the purchase, he discovered the reality of just how ""seriously mismanaged"" the company had been. ""Things had been going wrong for a considerable time and as soon as we arrived the extent of the under-investment became increasingly apparent,"" he told the Telegraph. ""There were ovens that had been broken for several months, and there was a leak in the bakery roof. Suppliers were often left unpaid, while new ones were sought. Overall, it was not a good culture. ""When someone decides to stop using butter in the puff pastry – in a patisserie - you know that something serious has happened. At the same time there was no head of health and safety in place, which for a food business is extraordinary. It was symptomatic of what was going on across the business.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/popular-high-street-bakery-shut-30836388,https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30836492.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JAR_BRK_090120_PatVal_01jpeg.jpg,2023-08-31 23:51:58,Ryan Merrifield,en,gb,-0.463
141479767,B&M buys up to 51 stores from collapsed rival Wilko,"Discount chain B&M has agreed to buy dozens of shops from the collapsed retailer Wilko, as talks over a bigger rescue deal hang in the balance. B&M said it will take on up to 51 of Wilko's 400 stores in a deal worth £13m. Wilko fell into administration in August as it struggled with sharp losses and a cash shortage. It is understood that a deal tabled by HMV's owner has stalled over issues with suppliers and funding. Wilko was founded in 1930 and by the 1990s became one of Britain's fastest-growing retailers. But the discount chain has faced strong competition from rivals including B&M, Poundland and Home Bargains, as the high cost of living has pushed shoppers to seek out bargains. Wilko's stores remain open for now as it seeks a buyer for a bigger chunk of the estate, but more than 12,500 jobs were put at risk by the collapse. The first redundancies - 269 jobs at Wilko's support centre in Worksop and 14 others at a subsidiary firm - started on Monday. B&M has not confirmed which Wilko shops it has bought, or how many posts could be saved as a result of the deal. The money raised by the sale will help recover funds for Wilko's creditors, as administrators PwC oversee the running of the business with all of its associated costs such as employee wages. Retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth said the deal would also allow B&M to attract more customers. The chain has stepped up its expansion plans in the wake of the pandemic, opening 21 new stores in the last financial year. ""This may also create local jobs for Wilko colleagues in the newly-owned stores,"" Ms Shuttleworth said. Several retailers and investors have reportedly been in talks with PwC about potentially buying Wilko's shops or online brand. At the end of last week, Canadian billionaire Doug Putman was thought to be edging closer to a deal to buy up to 300 shops. In 2019, his company Sunrise Records bought the collapsed music chain HMV and saved some 1,500 jobs and about 100 stores. That takeover resulted in redundancies and shop closures, including the company's flagship Oxford Street store in London - but following a major turnaround, plans are in place to reopen it later this year. Mr Putman's plan to buy Wilko is still ""live"", a source familiar with the situation told the BBC, but the businessman is apparently struggling to nail down final funding for the deal. The source said it was a complicated deal to stitch together, including sorting out terms with all-important suppliers to fill the shelves. They said everything possible was being done to give Mr Putman's bid its ""best shot"" and that discussions could continue for another few weeks. If Mr Putman's bid fails Wilko will likely go into what is called liquidation, with rival retailers picking up parcels of stores. Bill Grimsey, former boss of Wickes and Iceland, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme that he felt a sense of ""déjà vu"" when looking at Wilko's performance in recent years. ""It's Woolworth's all over again,"" he said, likening it to the once popular High Street chain which went bust in 2008. ""It's seen a loss of identity, it's got too many stores in the wrong place and competitors are racing ahead… They've been caught napping for the last 10 years."" Many Wilko shops are in High Street locations in traditional town centres. While these locations are convenient for shoppers without cars, since the pandemic there's been a shift to bigger retail parks and out-of-town options with more space, benefiting Wilko rivals like B&M and Poundland.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66711168?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F058/production/_130982516_gettyimages-1599060690.jpg,2023-09-05 12:48:53,Lora Jones,en,gb,-0.076
138189627,The FTC May Crack Down on Walmart&#8217;s Pricing Practices,"Every week, I go onto Walmart’s website and order a bunch of groceries to be delivered to my house and then feel a little bit guilty. Walmart is a multi-billion dollar corporation with headquarters more than 1,000 miles from my home; the money I spend there goes to shareholders and executives who live far away, instead of to my local grocery store, Key Food, an 86-year-old co-op of independently owned stores based near my home in New York. By shopping at Walmart, I am likely contributing to the demise of the independently-owned grocery store, which is disappearing across the country. But the prices make the choice easy. On a recent day, the 42-oz tub of Quaker Oats I get each week was $9.99 at Key Foods and $5.68 at Walmart; a 500 ml bottle of California Olive Ranch olive oil was $14.49 at Key Foods and $8.37 at Walmart; Rao’s homemade tomato sauce was $9.99, while I could have gotten the exact same item on Walmart for $6.88. On these three items alone, I saved $14 by shopping at Walmart. These prices are one reason that Walmart captures one in four grocery dollars in America, but there’s an argument to be made that Walmart and other big chains including Dollar General, which is expanding at a rapid clip across the country, come by those prices unfairly because of their market power. There’s a law on the books—1936’s Robinson-Patman Act—that essentially says suppliers in any industry can’t give lower prices and special deals to big chain stores if it costs the same to serve them as other stores. The law also says retailers can’t try and bully suppliers into giving those discounts. But because Walmart and dollar stores are so huge, representing a big part of a supplier’s business, they’re able to extract deals and low prices from suppliers, according to Small Business Rising and the Main Street Competition Coalition, two groups of independent business owners making their case in Congressional hearings and television ads. The pandemic highlighted just how unfairly Walmart can wield its power, the small businesses are telling regulators, because it was able to demand that suppliers stock its shelves when competitors weren’t able to get the same products for weeks or months. It’s not just groceries; independent pharmacies, book stores, auto parts stores, and other types of retailers are also struggling on an uneven playing field, they say. I Tried to Live Off Women-Owned Businesses. Turns Out, Men Still Run Everything Walmart’s leverage may seem like a good deal for consumers like me. In an era of runaway inflation, who doesn’t want the lowest prices they can get? But during the pandemic, it meant consumers living in lower-income areas far from big box stores weren’t able to get the groceries they needed. And the rise of Walmart contributes to the demise of those independent stores, the grocers say. Since suppliers lose money by giving such low prices to stores like Walmart, they increase the prices they charge to other stores, a phenomenon economists have called the “waterbed effect.” The higher-priced stores struggle, lose customers and go out of business. Then the big box stores, their dominance established and their competitors wiped out, raise prices, the grocers say. “Walmart’s consolidation of the grocery market has led to people paying higher prices across the board,” says Stacy Mitchell, co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), an advocacy group challenging consolidation of corporations. At Walmart, for instance, an NPR investigation found that Walmart prices went up around 23% between August 2019 and December 2022; some of the steepest hikes included Quaker Old-Fashioned Oats, which climbed 73% between August 2019 and December 2022; and Bounty paper towels, which increased 67%, says Mitchell. Consolidation in the economy has increased prices across many industries, according to a recent paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ILSR also points to the success of Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Family Dollar stores in spreading across America, pushing independent grocers out of business, as another reason there’s an uneven playing field. They say the dominance of huge chain stores is proof the Robinson-Patman Act needs to be enforced. Walmart did not respond to multiple requests for comment. FMI, the Food Industry Association, which represents Walmart, Target, and many other grocers, declined to comment. Neither Dollar General nor Dollar Tree, which also owns Family Dollar, returned a request for comment. The argument that big chains need to be reined in has gained traction with the Federal Trade Commission, which is tasked with enforcing the Robinson-Patman Act. Under Chairperson Lina Khan, appointed in 2021, the FTC has embarked on an aggressive path of antitrust enforcement, and in March, Khan said that the agency wanted to bring more cases under the law “in short order.” (Khan wrote an influential critique of how antitrust policy failed to rein in Amazon while a student at Columbia Law School.) In addition, FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya has embarked on a listening tour around the country, meeting with independent grocery stores and pharmacy operators and talking about how Robinson-Patman enforcement could help them thrive. The FTC has reportedly opened a preliminary investigation recently into whether pricing practices at Coca-Cola and PepsiCo violated Robinson-Patman, but has not yet brought a formal action. “The law may be broken—grocery stores like yours, in the way I read the law, should be able to access the same deals as your competitors,” Bedoya told a room of people in July as he visited Oasis, an independent grocery store that opened in 2021 in North Tulsa, Okla., after the city passed an ordinance limiting the proliferation of dollar stores. “One of the big things that means is no secret discounts, no secret deals for one company versus another.” Bedoya visited Oasis, which has thrived in a predominantly Black neighborhood, and Buche’s, an independent grocery store in Pine Ridge, S.D., in part because he hopes that enforcement of the law will allow more stores like them to proliferate. “I do think that the corporate power in this country is such that slowly, folks—no matter what their politics are—are starting to say this is too much,” he said, to the people gathered, who included local politicians, residents, and people from other communities hoping to open independent grocery stores. “My hope is that five or 10 or 15 years from now, there will be bipartisan agreement that we need to work harder to protect small businesses like Oasis.” A bipartisan group of 43 members of Congress, including representatives Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and W. Gregory Steube (R-Fla.) wrote a letter to the FTC in March of 2022 asking it to bring more actions against companies that have violated Robinson-Patman. “The anticompetitive effects of discriminatory pricing and product supply directed to certain businesses (sometimes but not always small and medium-sized businesses) ripple through the entire supply chain—harming consumers as well as independent producers,” they wrote in the letter. Why the Government May Go After Walmart That government officials are standing up for independent businesses represents a sea change in how we think about what’s good and bad for the American shopper. For decades, the FTC and Justice Department have focused antitrust enforcement on protecting consumers from monopolies that can drive up prices, and concluding that if a shopper is getting a good deal and prices are low, there’s no reason for the government to step in. Enforcing Robinson-Patman would mean the government will focus less on whether I’m getting a good deal on groceries and more on whether the fabric of my community—and others that look very different from it—are better off with the status quo. The biggest grocery stores and box stores aren’t evenly distributed around the country—they tend to be clumped in more affluent, suburban areas, Bedoya said, in an interview with TIME. Rural and urban areas are disproportionately served by independent grocers, and as dollar stores and big box stores come in and undercut those grocers on price, they go out of business. A Walmart located in the suburbs, even if it’s just eight or nine miles away from a center city, is not a good solution for neighborhoods where people don’t have cars or access to consistent public transit. “What you’re left with is some of the poorest people in the country, some of the people in the most underserved areas, are left without a place to buy fresh groceries or just groceries, period,” Bedoya says. For decades, small businesses in America have failed as lower-priced big box stores spread. Many Americans have, by and large, concluded—with views bolstered by pop culture hits like the movie You’ve Got Mail—that small stores can’t compete in a free market where big boxes can win on efficiency. But the FTC is challenging the long-held assumption that the death of independently-owned stores is inevitable in an age of Walmart and Amazon. “That was unequivocally the heart of Robinson-Patman,” says Bedoya. “That $1 spent at the local store becomes $30 within the community and that this is good for our community in a way that the chains are not.” The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936 in response to the supermarket giant A&P, which was spreading across the country and putting local grocers out of business. Congress decided that Robinson-Patman could help the independent grocers compete with A&P, which seemed important during the Great Depression when stores were going out of business left and right. A&P didn’t offer credit, like the local grocer did, and it didn’t deliver groceries, two reasons why Congress supported Robinson-Patman, says Bedoya. For a long time, from when it was passed until the late 1960s, Robinson-Patman was “a prime enforcement priority” of the FTC, John Kirkwood, an antitrust expert and professor of law at Seattle University School of Law. But the field of antitrust underwent a populist revolution starting in the late 1960s and 1970s, in which academics, lawyers, and eventually judges, decided it was more important to prioritize consumer welfare than small businesses. A 1969 report by Ralph Nader excoriated the Federal Trade Commission for protecting small businesses, arguing that doing so drove up prices for consumers. In the wake of the Nader report and the populist push to prioritize consumer welfare over all else, the FTC and Justice Department slowed the pace of bringing cases under Robinson-Patman. Those that they did bring were less and less successful, until it became extremely difficult to bring a Robinson-Patman case and win, says Kirkwood, who was the lead counsel on one of the last Robinson-Patman cases brought by the FTC, filed in 1988. The Problem With Walmart’s Low Prices On one hand, it makes sense Walmart would get lower prices from the cereal company or the juice seller. It’s ordering huge amounts of product and that sheer volume creates efficiencies that arguably save suppliers money. But the grocers are arguing that Walmart and big boxes aren’t actually creating efficiencies—while still using their size to extract deals. The law allows for suppliers to give retailers a better price if it saves them money to do so, says Bedoya. “If it’s actually cheaper to make and sell someone 1,000 widgets because of some efficiency that you earn at the factory, fine, pass it along, no problem,” he says. “But when it’s the purchaser of 1,000 widgets saying, ‘Hey, I’m big and powerful and you’re gonna give me this deal no matter what,’ for almost 100 years, the federal government has responded with ‘you can’t do that.’” Many independent grocers have banded together into cooperatives so they’ll have more bargaining power. Those giant co-ops buy billions of dollars of groceries and have warehouses all around the country, just like Walmart does. Associated Wholesale Grocers, for instance, is a food co-op that serves 3,400 member supermarkets, representing $24 billion in sales. By contrast, there are 4,631 Walmarts in the U.S. AWG buys goods by the truckload, rather than the case, so a supplier sends a truck to its warehouse in the same way it would send a truck to Walmart, says David Smith, the president and chief executive officer of Associated Wholesale Grocers (AWG). When Robinson-Patman was enforced in the 1970s, says Smith, who grew up in the grocery business, suppliers would issue rate cards to tell grocery stores how much an item cost, depending on how much the stores bought. A case, a pallet, and a full truckload of a product would all have different rates. But in the last three decades, he says, as Walmart has grown and gained market power, “there’s no transparency whatsoever. And what’s happening is efficiency is being surpassed by leverage.” As Walmart has grown over the last three decades, it has gained leverage because of its huge market share—25% of all groceries purchased, compared to around 10% at competitors like Kroger and Costco. AWG’s stores are around 6,000 square feet, compared to 110,000 of a typical Walmart, says Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy office at Publicis Group —and so they buy far less product overall. Suppliers haven’t issued list prices to retailers in decades, Goldberg says; instead, they sit down with retailers and negotiate prices alongside joint marketing spending and product placement. Deals are very hard to compare because they have so many moving parts, but one thing is for sure: “The retailers with the least leverage are going to pay the most,” he says, “and the biggest retailers with the most leverage are going to pay the least.” The grocers say that the discounts Walmart gets are not commensurate with the efficiencies the company creates. Many store owners have experiences like that of R.F. Buche, who owns 23 independent grocery, convenience, and hardware stores in South Dakota, including the store that Bedoya visited in Pine Ridge. He will sometimes walk into a Walmart and see lower prices on the shelves than he can get wholesale through AWG. In December, for instance, he saw Walmart selling a dozen eggs for $2.27 when he was buying them for $3; Walmart was selling iceberg lettuce for $1.88 a head when he was getting it for $4.46. “My customers just don’t understand when they look at my shelf price and Walmart’s shelf price,” says Buche, who has had to sell three stores since 2019 because it was impossible to keep them afloat. Read More: Maybe Americans Don’t Mind High Prices Anymore Suppliers’ allegiance to Walmart worsened during the pandemic, say Buche and other grocers. Because Walmart makes up such a big share of a supplier’s business, they could demand on-time delivery even during the pandemic, when everything was running late. In September 2020, Walmart told suppliers they needed to be making on-time and in-full shipments 98% of the time or face steep fines; as a result, suppliers shifted whatever they had available to Walmart. Buche and independent grocers, on the other hand, couldn’t get the items their customers needed, and so their customers switched over to the box stores. It’s perfectly legal for Walmart to enforce those terms; independents could try enforcing them too, but would likely have a harder time doing so because they represent a much smaller share of a suppliers’ business. Suppliers mince no words explaining how dependent they are on Walmart; in regulatory filings, giants like Kraft Heinz and Nestle mention Walmart by name, explaining that consolidation in grocery has led to customers with increased purchasing power, and that those customers can demand lower pricing, more favorable terms, and more promotional programs. Buche says he’s still “on allocation” from hundreds of manufacturers, meaning he can only get a certain amount of certain products, while he sees no evidence of such shortages at Walmart. Sometimes, stores like Dollar General and Walmart will stock products that he isn’t even offered—different sizes or configurations. That’s what is unfair, grocers say—that there appears to be a whole different market for the big guys that’s invisible to everyone else. “If we’re willing to purchase the same quantities of product as the competition, we should be afforded the same price,” says Chris Jones, senior vice president of government relations at the National Grocers Association, a trade group representing independent grocers. “But those conversations don’t even happen.” Advocates for business, however, say enforcement of Robinson-Patman would result in higher prices for consumers. By enforcing the law, said former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright at a Cato Institute event in 2022, the government would not be prioritizing consumer welfare, but would be instead just assuming that “big is bad.” Who Gets Hurt When Independent Stores Go Out of Business If you live near a box store—and 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart—it may not seem important that there are fewer independent grocery stores, or that prices are going up at those places. Indeed, some analysts make the argument that small stores aren’t really that necessary, especially in the world of e-commerce. Walmart delivers to my house, after all—can’t it also deliver to food deserts? “There’s simply no legitimate argument that somehow the U.S. will be worse off if smaller groceries go out of business—as long as there is a replacement for consumers to buy groceries,” says Britain Ladd, a logistics analyst who has tracked the disappearance of small grocery stores. Even if Robinson-Pattman were enforced and prices from suppliers were more even, he argues, many independent grocery stores would fail anyway. They can’t invest in the automation or technology that the giants can, and have a harder time keeping costs down. But communities that have lost independent grocery stores say their residents don’t have any other options. “Everyone deserves access to healthy foods and eating options,” says Latisha Brunson, a council woman in Pine Bluff, Ark., where a grocery store closed in November 2022, leaving her ward the only one in the city without one. Her ward does have dollar stores with shelf-stable products, but now residents can’t shop for fresh food without a car. Read More: The Fight Over Non-Competes Is Heating Up. The FTC Must Stand Strong In theory, Robinson-Patman should have helped keep Pine Bluff’s independent grocer’s open. But it’s going to be “a heavy lift” for the FTC to successfully start enforcing the law again, says Kirkwood, the Seattle University professor. If the FTC does file cases under Robinson-Patman, they will eventually end up in appeals courts and maybe even the Supreme Court, and both are likely to take a dim view of it because they are so conservative, he says. “You’d have to go up against these judges [who think] it’s the left-wing FTC trying to revive the Robinson-Patman Act when sensible business types think it is a bad idea,” he says. Prosecuting a Robinson-Patman violation might work if the government can prove that consumers, not just small businesses, were the victims of this price bullying, says Kirkwood. This seems to be the FTC’s tack, and could be why Commissioner Bedoya is visiting communities like North Tulsa and Pine Ridge, where dollar stores and big boxes have made it hard for independent groceries to compete and for consumers to get the groceries they need. However, there’s a big question for consumers here: whether the FTC’s enforcement actions could drive prices up. I like the idea of shopping at Key Foods, after all, but my pocketbook vastly prefers the cheap prices at Walmart. I should, I suppose, be willing to pay a little more so that Americans living far from a big box store can also get fresh groceries, but few people are going to volunteer to pay higher prices on behalf of an unknown fellow citizen. Economists are still divided on whether Robinson-Patman enforcement truly raises prices; there are studies that show it does, and studies that show it doesn’t. If the FTC can somehow prove that enforcement won’t raise prices, that it will instead create a country with big chain stores and small independents with similar prices, it may have a fighting chance at restarting enforcement after more than 30 years. But it’s going to be an uphill battle. And if people like me keep shopping at Walmart while they fight that battle, giving Walmart even leverage, it could get even harder.

138200147,Who I’m Hurting By Shopping At Walmart,"Every week, I go onto Walmart’s website and order a bunch of groceries to be delivered to my house and then feel a little bit guilty. Walmart is a multi-billion dollar corporation with headquarters more than 1,000 miles from my home; the money I spend there goes to shareholders and executives who live far away, instead of to my local grocery store, Key Food, an 86-year-old co-op of independently owned stores based near my home in New York. By shopping at Walmart, I am likely contributing to the demise of the independently-owned grocery store, which is disappearing across the country. But the prices make the choice easy. On a recent day, the 42-oz tub of Quaker Oats I get each week was $9.99 at Key Foods and $5.68 at Walmart; a 500 ml bottle of California Olive Ranch olive oil was $14.49 at Key Foods and $8.37 at Walmart; Rao’s homemade tomato sauce was $9.99, while I could have gotten the exact same item on Walmart for $6.88. On these three items alone, I saved $14 by shopping at Walmart. These prices are one reason that Walmart captures one in four grocery dollars in America, but there’s an argument to be made that Walmart and other big chains including Dollar General, which is expanding at a rapid clip across the country, come by those prices unfairly because of their market power. There’s a law on the books—1936’s Robinson-Patman Act—that essentially says suppliers in any industry can’t give lower prices and special deals to big chain stores if it costs the same to serve them as other stores. The law also says retailers can’t try and bully suppliers into giving those discounts. But because Walmart and dollar stores are so huge, representing a big part of a supplier’s business, they’re able to extract deals and low prices from suppliers, according to Small Business Rising and the Main Street Competition Coalition, two groups of independent business owners making their case in Congressional hearings and television ads. The pandemic highlighted just how unfairly Walmart can wield its power, the small businesses are telling regulators, because it was able to demand that suppliers stock its shelves when competitors weren’t able to get the same products for weeks or months. It’s not just groceries; independent pharmacies, book stores, auto parts stores, and other types of retailers are also struggling on an uneven playing field, they say. I Tried to Live Off Women-Owned Businesses. Turns Out, Men Still Run Everything Walmart’s leverage may seem like a good deal for consumers like me. In an era of runaway inflation, who doesn’t want the lowest prices they can get? But during the pandemic, it meant consumers living in lower-income areas far from big box stores weren’t able to get the groceries they needed. And the rise of Walmart contributes to the demise of those independent stores, the grocers say. Since suppliers lose money by giving such low prices to stores like Walmart, they increase the prices they charge to other stores, a phenomenon economists have called the “waterbed effect.” The higher-priced stores struggle, lose customers and go out of business. Then the big box stores, their dominance established and their competitors wiped out, raise prices, the grocers say. “Walmart’s consolidation of the grocery market has led to people paying higher prices across the board,” says Stacy Mitchell, co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), an advocacy group challenging consolidation of corporations. At Walmart, for instance, an NPR investigation found that Walmart prices went up around 23% between August 2019 and December 2022; some of the steepest hikes included Quaker Old-Fashioned Oats, which climbed 73% between August 2019 and December 2022; and Bounty paper towels, which increased 67%, says Mitchell. Consolidation in the economy has increased prices across many industries, according to a recent paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ILSR also points to the success of Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Family Dollar stores in spreading across America, pushing independent grocers out of business, as another reason there’s an uneven playing field. They say the dominance of huge chain stores is proof the Robinson-Patman Act needs to be enforced. Walmart did not respond to multiple requests for comment. FMI, the Food Industry Association, which represents Walmart, Target, and many other grocers, declined to comment. Neither Dollar General nor Dollar Tree, which also owns Family Dollar, returned a request for comment. The argument that big chains need to be reined in has gained traction with the Federal Trade Commission, which is tasked with enforcing the Robinson-Patman Act. Under Chairperson Lina Khan, appointed in 2021, the FTC has embarked on an aggressive path of antitrust enforcement, and in March, Khan said that the agency wanted to bring more cases under the law “in short order.” (Khan wrote an influential critique of how antitrust policy failed to rein in Amazon while a student at Columbia Law School.) In addition, FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya has embarked on a listening tour around the country, meeting with independent grocery stores and pharmacy operators and talking about how Robinson-Patman enforcement could help them thrive. The FTC has reportedly opened a preliminary investigation recently into whether pricing practices at Coca-Cola and PepsiCo violated Robinson-Patman, but has not yet brought a formal action. “The law may be broken—grocery stores like yours, in the way I read the law, should be able to access the same deals as your competitors,” Bedoya told a room of people in July as he visited Oasis, an independent grocery store that opened in 2021 in North Tulsa, Okla., after the city passed an ordinance limiting the proliferation of dollar stores. “One of the big things that means is no secret discounts, no secret deals for one company versus another.” Bedoya visited Oasis, which has thrived in a predominantly Black neighborhood, and Buche’s, an independent grocery store in Pine Ridge, S.D., in part because he hopes that enforcement of the law will allow more stores like them to proliferate. “I do think that the corporate power in this country is such that slowly, folks—no matter what their politics are—are starting to say this is too much,” he said, to the people gathered, who included local politicians, residents, and people from other communities hoping to open independent grocery stores. “My hope is that five or 10 or 15 years from now, there will be bipartisan agreement that we need to work harder to protect small businesses like Oasis.” A bipartisan group of 43 members of Congress, including representatives Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and W. Gregory Steube (R-Fla.) wrote a letter to the FTC in March of 2022 asking it to bring more actions against companies that have violated Robinson-Patman. “The anticompetitive effects of discriminatory pricing and product supply directed to certain businesses (sometimes but not always small and medium-sized businesses) ripple through the entire supply chain—harming consumers as well as independent producers,” they wrote in the letter. Why the Government May Go After Walmart That government officials are standing up for independent businesses represents a sea change in how we think about what’s good and bad for the American shopper. For decades, the FTC and Justice Department have focused antitrust enforcement on protecting consumers from monopolies that can drive up prices, and concluding that if a shopper is getting a good deal and prices are low, there’s no reason for the government to step in. Enforcing Robinson-Patman would mean the government will focus less on whether I’m getting a good deal on groceries and more on whether the fabric of my community—and others that look very different from it—are better off with the status quo. The biggest grocery stores and box stores aren’t evenly distributed around the country—they tend to be clumped in more affluent, suburban areas, Bedoya said, in an interview with TIME. Rural and urban areas are disproportionately served by independent grocers, and as dollar stores and big box stores come in and undercut those grocers on price, they go out of business. A Walmart located in the suburbs, even if it's just eight or nine miles away from a center city, is not a good solution for neighborhoods where people don’t have cars or access to consistent public transit. “What you’re left with is some of the poorest people in the country, some of the people in the most underserved areas, are left without a place to buy fresh groceries or just groceries, period,” Bedoya says. For decades, small businesses in America have failed as lower-priced big box stores spread. Many Americans have, by and large, concluded—with views bolstered by pop culture hits like the movie You’ve Got Mail—that small stores can’t compete in a free market where big boxes can win on efficiency. But the FTC is challenging the long-held assumption that the death of independently-owned stores is inevitable in an age of Walmart and Amazon. “That was unequivocally the heart of Robinson-Patman,” says Bedoya. “That $1 spent at the local store becomes $30 within the community and that this is good for our community in a way that the chains are not.” The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936 in response to the supermarket giant A&P, which was spreading across the country and putting local grocers out of business. Congress decided that Robinson-Patman could help the independent grocers compete with A&P, which seemed important during the Great Depression when stores were going out of business left and right. A&P didn’t offer credit, like the local grocer did, and it didn’t deliver groceries, two reasons why Congress supported Robinson-Patman, says Bedoya. For a long time, from when it was passed until the late 1960s, Robinson-Patman was “a prime enforcement priority” of the FTC, John Kirkwood, an antitrust expert and professor of law at Seattle University School of Law. But the field of antitrust underwent a populist revolution starting in the late 1960s and 1970s, in which academics, lawyers, and eventually judges, decided it was more important to prioritize consumer welfare than small businesses. A 1969 report by Ralph Nader excoriated the Federal Trade Commission for protecting small businesses, arguing that doing so drove up prices for consumers. In the wake of the Nader report and the populist push to prioritize consumer welfare over all else, the FTC and Justice Department slowed the pace of bringing cases under Robinson-Patman. Those that they did bring were less and less successful, until it became extremely difficult to bring a Robinson-Patman case and win, says Kirkwood, who was the lead counsel on one of the last Robinson-Patman cases brought by the FTC, filed in 1988. The Problem With Walmart's Low Prices On one hand, it makes sense Walmart would get lower prices from the cereal company or the juice seller. It’s ordering huge amounts of product and that sheer volume creates efficiencies that arguably save suppliers money. But the grocers are arguing that Walmart and big boxes aren’t actually creating efficiencies—while still using their size to extract deals. The law allows for suppliers to give retailers a better price if it saves them money to do so, says Bedoya. “If it's actually cheaper to make and sell someone 1,000 widgets because of some efficiency that you earn at the factory, fine, pass it along, no problem,” he says. “But when it's the purchaser of 1,000 widgets saying, ‘Hey, I'm big and powerful and you're gonna give me this deal no matter what,’ for almost 100 years, the federal government has responded with ‘you can't do that.’” Many independent grocers have banded together into cooperatives so they’ll have more bargaining power. Those giant co-ops buy billions of dollars of groceries and have warehouses all around the country, just like Walmart does. Associated Wholesale Grocers, for instance, is a food co-op that serves 3,400 member supermarkets, representing $24 billion in sales. By contrast, there are 4,631 Walmarts in the U.S. AWG buys goods by the truckload, rather than the case, so a supplier sends a truck to its warehouse in the same way it would send a truck to Walmart, says David Smith, the president and chief executive officer of Associated Wholesale Grocers (AWG). When Robinson-Patman was enforced in the 1970s, says Smith, who grew up in the grocery business, suppliers would issue rate cards to tell grocery stores how much an item cost, depending on how much the stores bought. A case, a pallet, and a full truckload of a product would all have different rates. But in the last three decades, he says, as Walmart has grown and gained market power, “there’s no transparency whatsoever. And what’s happening is efficiency is being surpassed by leverage.” As Walmart has grown over the last three decades, it has gained leverage because of its huge market share—25% of all groceries purchased, compared to around 10% at competitors like Kroger and Costco. AWG’s stores are around 6,000 square feet, compared to 110,000 of a typical Walmart, says Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy office at Publicis Group —and so they buy far less product overall. Suppliers haven’t issued list prices to retailers in decades, Goldberg says; instead, they sit down with retailers and negotiate prices alongside joint marketing spending and product placement. Deals are very hard to compare because they have so many moving parts, but one thing is for sure: “The retailers with the least leverage are going to pay the most,” he says, “and the biggest retailers with the most leverage are going to pay the least.” The grocers say that the discounts Walmart gets are not commensurate with the efficiencies the company creates. Many store owners have experiences like that of R.F. Buche, who owns 23 independent grocery, convenience, and hardware stores in South Dakota, including the store that Bedoya visited in Pine Ridge. He will sometimes walk into a Walmart and see lower prices on the shelves than he can get wholesale through AWG.

144328619,"UAW 2023 strike update: Why auto workers at GM, Ford, and Stellantis are walking off the job and how long the…","First it was the writers. Then it was the actors. Now, it’s the auto workers who are on strike after the United Auto Workers and Detroit’s Big Three — Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis (which owns Chrysler) — have failed to reach a deal in labor negotiations. This one is going to be a doozy as the UAW seeks to wrestle back some of the profits the automakers have been raking in. After midnight Friday, when the deadline for a new contract passed, some 12,700 workers at a Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan, a GM plant in Wentzville, Missouri, and a Stellantis plant in Toledo, Ohio, walked off the job. It marks the first time the UAW is striking at all three car companies. The auto workers are using a tactic of “stand up” strikes, where it will call on workers at certain specific plants to strike while others keep working under their expired contracts. “All options remain on the table,” said UAW President Shawn Fine in a speech on Facebook Live on Thursday evening. “National leadership will determine the appropriate targets and timing for further stand-up strike action. This is our generation’s defining moment. The money is there, the cause is righteous, the world is watching, and the UAW is ready to stand up.” The union hopes the strategy will give it leverage and keep the companies guessing as to what it’s going to do next. It will also help the UAW to stretch out its $825 million strike fund if the strike drags on — which it could, given the distance between the parties — and to escalate if need be. “I think of it as asymmetrical warfare. If you’re smaller than your opponent, you’re going to fight them asymmetrically. It’s how Americans fought the Revolutionary War,” said Ambrose Conroy, an auto expert and founder of Seraph Consulting. “[The union] can’t go head-on, they don’t have enough cash, they’re the weaker party here. The UAW doesn’t have the hundreds of billions of dollars in profit over the last decade that the Big Three have.” The UAW strike is going to have important implications for the automakers and workers involved. It’s also going to impact suppliers, supply chains, and consumers, depending on its scope and how long it lasts. At a time when there may have been some hope the car market would finally settle down, this is likely to upend at least parts of it. (If you were excited for car prices to fall in the near future, we’ve got some news for you.) The UAW believes the strikes are worth it. “The UAW knows it’s really now or never,” Conroy said. “If they don’t make this happen now, then they may not have a good opportunity in the future.” Just catching up? Here are six big questions surrounding the UAW strikes, answered. 1) Who is striking, and against who? The UAW represents about 400,000 workers total across a number of sectors, and about 146,000, or one-third of those, work at the Big Three automakers. UAW workers voted overwhelmingly back in August to strike if the union and the Big Three manufacturers couldn’t reach an agreement by the September 14 deadline. The initial three strike locations cover about 9 percent of the UAW’s membership, which is still going to cause a lot of disruption. The UAW is one of the country’s oldest unions; started in 1935, its official title is the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Like many American unions, including the Teamsters, the UAW has dealt with some very serious misconduct over the decades, including a recent bribery scandal involving Fiat Chrysler, part of Stellantis, paying about $3.5 million in bribes to UAW leadership in the hopes they’d acquiesce to bargaining terms favorable to Fiat Chrysler. Hoping to start fresh and take advantage of increasing labor support and power in the American workforce, the UAW narrowly elected Fain, an electrician and longtime UAW member, in a tight runoff election this March. It was the first time UAW members directly elected their leadership, a change that members voted for in 2021 in the wake of multiple corruption scandals, as the New York Times reported at the time. “Most people had no clue who he was,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University’s School of Labor Relations, told Vox. “I had not met him. I had not heard of him prior to him running for president, so it was one of those things where he was under the radar.” “Now, his persona is trying to shed some of the bad image,” Wheaton said, with Fain prioritizing transparency with membership while leadership is bargaining with the Big Three. “So he’s really gained and solidified this support very quickly through this negotiation process.” — Ellen Ioanes 2) What does the UAW want? There’s an elevated level of militancy within the UAW right now. Fain is a disruptive figure with a bit of an unorthodox approach. Many auto workers are angry — they signed their last contract in 2019, about six months before the Covid-19 virus took hold. The pandemic would lead to huge profits for their employers, even as their own wages stagnated. They believe now is the time to get back the ground many feel like they’ve given up over the last 20 years. “The UAW has a level of bitterness that we haven’t seen in decades right now,” Garrett Nelson, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, a financial intelligence firm. Initially, the union was asking for a 46 percent raise for members over the duration of their four-year contract, but it’s now come down to 36 percent. Ford and GM are offering 20 percent, Stellantis 17.5 percent. The union has asked for a 32-hour work week for 40 hours of pay as well as a reinstatement of traditional pensions, improved retirement health care, and guarantees on job security. It has taken aim at the auto makers’ reliance on temporary workers and wants them to be converted to full-time after 90 days of work, with full benefits. The UAW is also seeking to eliminate the two-tiered pay system where new hires are paid significantly less than more tenured workers, in place since 2007. Part of what these demands are ultimately about is better-quality jobs, said Kate Bahn, chief economist at the Urban Institute, told Vox. “It really struck me, when I was looking at the most recent jobs report, how manufacturing does seem to have longer hours than other hours — the average is just over 40” compared to an average of 37 hours per week across the labor force. That doesn’t include so-called critical status manufacturing drives, like Stellantis’s this past June, when, according to the UAW’s now-expired contract, plants could operate seven days per week for up to three months and require employees to work more overtime hours. Negotiating around working hours and other benefits in addition to salary could put in place longer-term changes in working conditions less dependent on the economy, Bahn said. There’s been a long-term decline in job quality over the past 40 years, which Bahn attributes to the decline in worker bargaining power. “When workers have less bargaining power, employers take advantage of that and make jobs worse,” she said. Ultimately, as the industry shifts to electric vehicles, the union says there needs to be a just transition from current manufacturing jobs to battery-powered EVs, and workers are worried the switch to electric vehicles could cost jobs. This kind of aggressive bargaining and push to have worker’s voices heard could help labor have more of a say in that transition, labor advocates say. The companies are negotiating separately with the UAW. Stellantis is likely to be able to hold out longer than Ford and GM, which means it can play a little more hardball. Still, nobody’s thrilled — both Stellantis and GM put out statements saying they’re “disappointed” with the UAW’s actions, and Ford said it could not agree to the union’s “unsustainable terms.” — Emily Stewart and Ellen Ioanes 3) What led up to this? Fain and company’s asks might seem extreme out of context, but in order to understand where the UAW is coming from, you have to look back to the union’s 2007 contract and the subsequent auto industry bailout of 2008 and 2009. “A lot of that Great Recession really hit the auto industry tough,” Wheaton said. When the US government decided to bail out the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis, that came with a lot of company restructuring, as well as changes to the union’s 2007 contract framed as cost-cutting measures. “Part of [the government bailout] was restructuring the wages to try to be closer to what the non-union companies were making,” Wheaton said. The union agreed to a two-tiered wage system, in which those hired before 2007 received one wage, and those hired after were paid a little more than half that. The automakers also made more use of temporary and part-time workers, and did away with defined-benefit pensions and cost-of-living allowances, among other union benefits. It worked at the time, but over the past 14 years the auto industry has seen massive sales and record profits, and workers haven’t been able to share in those successes — and in a way, they’re still paying for the bailout. “Part of what’s motivating [wage increases] is an interest in the workers sharing in the success that the company has been experiencing, and share in it in a way that seems commensurate with the way that the corporate leadership has shared in that success,” Sharon Block, executive director of Harvard Law School’s Center for Labor and a Just Economy, told Vox. “When you think about it as an increase that represents a fair share of profits from three very profitable companies of late, it may look different.” — EI 4) What is the impact of the strike? The UAW’s stand-up strike tactics will have a “devastating impact,” Nelson said. “It could really turn into a logistical nightmare for the automakers as it relates to the supply chain, because the automakers will have to adjust their deliveries of parts to the different factories,” he said. “The average automobile contains over 30,000 parts, and the automotive supply chain is one of the most complex of any industry.” Automakers have inventory to weather the early storm, but that will be depleted over time. GM appears to be in a more precarious position than Stellantis or Ford. Parts and equipment suppliers will take a hit, too, amid disruptions. “Most major auto suppliers count on the Detroit Three for between 25 and 45 percent of their total net sales, so you could see furloughs of the suppliers, production cuts, and so forth, where it could really have a crippling effect across the industry,” Nelson said. The longer the UAW and Big Three are at an impasse and the longer the strike goes on, the worse the situation gets for a variety of parties, including car dealers and, of course, for consumers. The car market has been pretty wonky over the past few years — supply chain issues and semiconductor shortages have hurt supply, and people rushing to buy cars during the pandemic upped demand. The price tags on new and used cars had been pretty rich, and even with some prices coming down, rising interest rates have meant pricier car loans. “Consumers are trying to get back to a place where things are a bit more normal,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, a consumer research company. The strikes means they’re going to have to wait. In the immediate term, many incentives for buyers are likely out the window, as are many special orders on new vehicles. Prices on new vehicles are likely to move higher pretty quickly, as are, eventually, prices on used vehicles. “This goes for more than a couple of months, and all bets are off,” Conroy said. It’s perhaps not all negative — Wheaton said he believes if the UAW is successful, it could energize union drives across the auto sector. “If you can make big gains at the bargaining table, it will help you as you’re doing organizing drives for more than half of the US market that’s not union for the auto sector,” he said. Higher salaries and better benefits, he argued, could make joining the UAW a more tempting prospect for employees at nonunion manufacturers like Kia and BMW. — ES and EI 5) What does this mean for the economy? According to a report from the Anderson Economic Group put out in August, a 10-day strike against all three Detroit automakers would cost the economy $5 billion. The fallout may not be that severe, depending on how the stand-up strikes continue to play out, but the scenario still isn’t good. The UAW stoppage on its own is not enough to create a massive drag on the US economy, though it depends on how long it lasts and whether it coincides with other negative factors. “If it’s a month or two, then you’ll have a meaningful impact on GDP, let’s say, and jobs in the fourth quarter, but it will be small in the grand scheme of things,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “We currently have a triple threat on the economy from the strikes of these autoworkers, from the risk of a government shutdown, and from the resumption of student debt payments,” said Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. Combined, they could shave a more significant amount off of GDP. On a more micro level, the strike will negatively impact Michigan’s economy. The economy is strong right now, and it’s proven resilient, but we’re not out of the clear. “We have not soft-landed, we are still in the landing process,” he said. — ES 6) What does this have to do with all the other strikes happening? It’s not like the writers and actors called up the UAW and told them to hop in at the tail end of Hot Strike Summer. Each group has their own set of issues they’re trying to sort out with their respective counterparts. But there are elements of the current zeitgeist that these strikes share. The labor market is tight and it has been for a while, and workers have a lot of power. (Yes, there are signs the labor market is cooling, but it’s still pretty strong.) It’s also a moment when many workers are seeing just how well their employers have done in recent years without sharing much of the pie. “Profit margins have come in a little bit, but they’re still well above where they were pre-pandemic, so I think workers see that and they’re asking, well, does that make a whole lot of sense?” Zandi said. Hollywood studios, while struggling with streaming, are making a lot of money. The same goes for automakers. “The pandemic was a boon for automakers. Prices surged, their profits surged, and real wages of the workers really took a hit,” Nelson said. Technology is a looming threat that has workers on edge as well — in the case of writers and actors, artificial intelligence, and in the case of autoworkers, the transition to electric vehicles. “There’s a lot of angst here about how things are going to play out,” Zandi said. It’s worth pointing out here that, despite the headlines, unions have been declining in America for decades. Strikes are hard on workers, including the ones not even doing the striking. The auto workers, like the actors and the writers, have walked off the job in this moment because they see their industry at a turning point, and believe this is the time to take a stand. — ES",https://www.vox.com/2023/9/15/23875044/uaw-strike-news-contract-demands-wentzville-toledo-wayne,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2NdydiNves1u2Nuxdwjz4dfutQ=/0x418:3000x1989/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24924225/1667152310.jpg,2023-09-15 20:30:00,Emily Stewart,en,us,0.009000000000000001
143457419,Biden admin seeks to lock up critical minerals with eco protections amid green energy push,"The Biden administration published a long-awaited final report outlining steps and policy recommendations it said would help modernize mining regulations, but critics say they would create more burdensome red tape. The federal Interagency Working Group on Mining Laws, Regulations, and Permitting (IWG) published the report listing 65 recommendations Tuesday, saying it will inform efforts to update the General Mining Act of 1872. Environmentalists have long called on the federal government to update laws to ensure more stringent protections for wildlife, plants and the environment surrounding mining projects. ""The biggest takeaway from the report is that our 150-year-old law, literally the 1872 mining law signed by President Graham for accessing minerals on public lands, needs to be reformed and brought into the 21st century,"" IWG Chair and Deputy Interior Secretary Tommy Beaudreau told reporters during a press call. BIDEN'S LATEST ECO REGS BLASTED BY SMALL BUSINESSES, MANUFACTURERS: 'WILL DO TERRIBLE DAMAGE' ""We need to employ the same tools that have been so successful in standing up thousands of megawatts of renewable energy on public lands and offshore,"" he continued. ""This includes a leasing program that targets resources while reducing conflicts with local communities, wildlife habitat and essential water resources."" In addition to recommending a leasing program for critical mineral deposits, Beaudreau added that the report recommends that companies pay royalties on land they are approved to mine for resource development. He explained that the current structure with no royalties is why there is little funding for addressing abandoned mines he said create ""safety hazards and pollution for land and water across our country."" BIDEN ADMIN ECO RULE CURBING OIL DRILLING, MINING FACES WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION In addition, the report recommends a controversial 7-cent per ton fee on material displaced by hard rock mining, a proposal that would also increase prices for the mining industry, dubbing the fee a ""dirt tax."" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced the creation of the IWG in February 2022, months after the White House ordered a review of the domestic supply chain and recommended solutions to expand ""sustainable, responsible critical minerals production and processing."" Haaland said the task force's work was important to ""meet the needs of the clean energy economy."" ""Unfortunately, if the Biden-Harris administration’s stated objective is to secure our nation’s domestic mineral supply chains while supporting responsible mining, the recommendations contained in this report don’t do anything to advance the ball,"" Rich Nolan, the president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. ""In fact, some of the recommendations — including the consideration of a leasing system, imposition of a punitive dirt tax or application of the higher end of suggested proposed royalties — will throw additional obstacles in the way of responsible domestic projects and would-be investment, forcing the U.S. to double-down on our already outsized import reliance from countries with questionable labor, safety and environmental practices."" GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE Nolan added that, while his organization is still reviewing the report, the U.S. remains ""critically outmatched"" on mining for critical minerals needed for key technologies. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, also blasted the IWG report Tuesday. ""President Biden is taking a sledgehammer to affordable, reliable energy,"" Barrasso said. ""Today’s proposed mining reforms will force us to buy more critical minerals from mines using forced and child labor instead of harnessing our abundant resources here at home. ""Permitting mines in the U.S. can take over a decade,"" the Wyoming Republican added. ""These proposals will slow the process even further. If the Biden administration’s reforms are enacted, Americans will be even more dependent on imports from our adversaries, including China."" However, the report was lauded by Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the House Natural Resources Committee ranking member who has led efforts in recent years to create a new regulatory regime governing mining nationwide. Grijalva said Tuesday he would work to implement the ""long-overdue reforms"" outlined in the IWG report via legislation such as Grijalva and Democratic New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich's Energy Minerals Reform Act. Critical minerals are a vital component of the burgeoning green energy industry. Green energy technologies like electric vehicle batteries, battery storage facilities, solar panels and wind turbines require a massive expansion of cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, graphite, zinc and other mineral production, according to the International Energy Agency. For example, an electric vehicle requires 500% more mineral resources than a traditional gas-powered car while a single onshore wind turbine plant requires 800% more minerals than a typical fossil fuel plant. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP China and other hostile nations dominate the global mineral supply chain even as the U.S. and Western nations rapidly push a transition to green energy technologies. In 2022, the U.S. mined just 3.8% of global copper supplies, 5.9% of global zinc supplies, 0.55% of global nickel supplies, 0.42% of global cobalt supplies and 0% of global graphite supplies, federal data showed. At the same time, the Biden administration has taken steps to slow mineral production. The Department of the Interior has moved ahead with 20-year mining bans in areas rich with key minerals in Minnesota and South Dakota, while President Biden has established national monuments in Nevada and Arizona, effectively blocking mining in those areas.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-seeks-lock-up-critical-minerals-eco-protections-amid-green-energy-push,https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/01/931/523/8ab553e2-AP21021747656668.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,2023-09-13 00:46:15,President Graham,en,us,0.14300000000000002
140418233,Fake spare parts were supplied to fix top-selling jet engine,"European aviation regulators have determined that an obscure London-based company supplied bogus parts for repairs of jet engines that power many older-generation Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 planes. Manufacturing partners General Electric and Safran have been assisting in the probe of allegedly faked certification documents and unapproved parts for CFM56 engines that were distributed by London-based AOG Technics, according to the companies, public regulatory filings and letters to operators viewed by Bloomberg. ""Numerous Authorised Release Certificates for parts supplied via AOG Technics have been forged,” the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a statement in response to Bloomberg queries. In each case, the organization identified as the manufacturer ""confirmed that they did not produce the certificate, and that they were not the originator of the part,” EASA said. The spread of undocumented or potentially faked parts into the engine supply chain is rare and treated with utmost urgency in an industry where every component requires verified provenance to ensure aircraft safety — it’s impossible to know whether uncertified parts will be as durable under stress. Manufacturers and regulators sounded the alarm weeks ago, triggering a global scramble to trace parts supplied by AOG Technics and identify affected aircraft. It’s unclear how many fake parts may have been installed or how many aircraft might be affected. The CFM56, the world’s best-selling jet engine, is installed on thousands of narrow-body planes that are a staple of the global fleet. EASA told operators this month to quarantine parts that are backed by false documentation. It said Thursday that to date, AOG Technics had failed to provide detail on the actual origin of the questionable parts. ""The documentation of parts is a very critical issue,” said Klaus Mueller, a senior adviser at AeroDynamic Advisory and a former senior executive at MTU Aero Engines and Deutsche Lufthansa’s maintenance arm. ""The industry is taking this topic very, very seriously.” Regulator warnings Middleman like AOG Technics supply parts to third-party engine-repair shops working on in-service commercial aircraft. New engines from CFM International, the GE-Safran manufacturing venture, wouldn’t be affected by the issue, nor would the CFM56’s successor, the CFM Leap, which is used on the latest A320neo and 737 Max narrowbodies. Still, the matter creates a new headache for airlines and lessors that discover suspect parts on their aircraft. Maintenance and repair shops are grappling with labor deficits, a global shortage of aircraft and engine parts and monthslong waits for shop visits. The U.K.’s Civil Aviation Authority said in an Aug. 4 safety notice that it was investigating ""a large number of Suspect Unapproved Parts” supplied through AOG Technics. Some components with false airworthiness release certificates were found on engines fitted to aircraft registered in the U.K., the filing said. CFM has unearthed 72 falsified airworthiness certification documents spanning 50 part numbers supplied by AOG Technics for the CFM56, according to a spokesman for the manufacturer. Two falsified documents for components of GE’s CF6 engine, an earlier wide-body powerplant, were also found, he said. ""We proactively alerted our customers and maintenance shops, and we continue to work with our customers to assess the authenticity of documentation for parts they acquired directly or indirectly from AOG Technics,” CFM said in response to queries. Shares of GE dipped briefly on the Bloomberg report but have since recovered. Safran was down 0.4% at the close of trading in Paris. Cease-and-desist The company at the center of the controversy isn’t an approved vendor for CFM or GE, the CFM spokesman said. GE and Safran each sent cease-and-desist letters to AOG Technics, he said. AOG Technics didn’t respond to calls and messages. Its website describes the company as a ""leading global aircraft support provider” and a source of new and ""serviceable” parts for a variety of engines that power 737 and A320 models. The company said it had warehouse operations in London, Frankfurt, Miami and Singapore. According to the U.K.’s Companies House website, AOG Technics was incorporated in 2015 and is majority owned by 35-year-old Jose Zamora Yrala, whose nationality is listed as British on some forms and Venezuelan on others. The company listed current assets of £2.58 million ($3.27 million) as of February 2022. It was not possible to reach Yrala. Letters to operators In a July 28 letter to all CFM56 customers that was seen by Bloomberg, CFM said Paris-based Safran had filed suspected unapproved parts notifications with EASA after a maintenance shop questioned the authenticity of documents provided by AOG Technics for a new CFM56 part. After determining the document was falsified, CFM and the engine shop searched through other records provided by AOG and found ""significant discrepancies” with EASA certificates and shipment documents, according to the letter. Three days later, GE sent a separate ""All Operators Wire” to CF6 customers and maintenance shops, alerting them to ""a recently identified falsified certification document” related to the sale of several CF6 engine parts with the same part number. The information was shared ""as a precaution while GE and FAA investigations progress,” the letter said. Europe’s regulator issued its notice of suspected unapproved parts days later, asking aircraft owners, operators, maintenance organizations and parts distributors to inspect their records for parts obtained directly or indirectly from the London firm. ""If a part with a falsified ARC is already installed, then it is recommended that the part be replaced with an approved part,” EASA’s Aug. 4 filing said, referring to the authorized release certificate which identifies the approved originator of the part. It added that the European safety agency ""might take further action” as a result of the ongoing investigations. An EASA official said Wednesday that the agency was continuing to monitor responses to determine whether any further actions were needed. The U.K.’s CAA had no immediate comment. The FAA didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2023/09/01/companies/fake-parts-boeing-airbus/,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/09/01/249216.jpg,2023-09-01 05:32:56,Julie Johnsson,en,jp,-0.867
145242805,Gas suppliers lament increasing prices of diesel,"The Natural Oil and Gas Suppliers Association of Nigeria (NOGASA) on Tuesday expressed concern over the incessant increases in the price of diesel in the market. Benneth Korie, NOGASA president in a statement on Tuesday said the rapid increase in diesel prices has made it difficult for suppliers to access products and loans from commercial banks for doing their business. “These rising prices are also evidently causing veritable hardships to haulage transportation and commuters alike,” he said. Mr Korie, therefore, called on the government to intervene before it derails the anticipated growth the government is working towards achieving. He explained that the meeting of the association slated for October will look into steps towards finding lasting solutions to the problem. Mr Korie said the association is worried about the ugly development and is trying to understand why prices of diesel continue to rise to between N950 to N1100 per litre. He added that the price of crude oil as of today is 95 dollars per barrel and the dollar exchange is racing towards N1000 per dollar. Consequently, he added that the Nigerian refineries should be given emergency attention by the government to forestall the nose-diving of the economy. ALSO READ: Army intercepts 16,000 litres of adulterated diesel “The Natural Oil and Gas Suppliers Association of Nigeria has been playing a pivotal role in the oil and gas industry and will continue to ensure the availability of adequate supplies of products to Nigerians. “We will continue to deliver on our mandate as we make progress in the oil and gas industry,” he said.

139076333,Bumpy ride for billionaire brothers who banked on Asda’s success,"When the billionaire Issa brothers parked up outside Asda’s Leeds headquarters in February 2021, they had just secured the keys to a business that seemed to present an incredible opportunity: a 600-stores-plus cash machine. The brothers from Blackburn were set on leapfrogging slightly bigger rival Sainsbury’s to make Asda the UK’s second-largest supermarket group. They promised £1bn of investment to fly the brand’s bright green banner above hundreds more convenience stores, many of which would be based on their own EG Group’s petrol forecourts, and to fill unwanted supermarket space with takeaways from their string of franchise partners, from KFC to Subway. Asda’s previous owner, the US retail group Walmart, had spent some time trying to exit Asda – including an abortive 2018 merger with Sainsbury’s. After that deal was scuppered by competition concerns, the Issa brothers provided the perfect opportunity for Walmart’s owners, the billionaire Walton family, to offload the chain near the top of the market. The deal was inked in October 2020 and a finalised the following February. The road since then has been increasingly bumpy, as the pandemic grocery boom (remember pasta and toilet roll stockpiling?) gave way to surging inflation, rising interest rates and a cost of living crisis. The boys from Blackburn Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who share a £5bn fortune, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list, grew up in a terrace house in Blackburn and started their empire with one petrol station in nearby Bury after working in their father’s garage. They made their fortune through buying up forecourts across the UK, and then globally, to build a business with more than 6,600 outlets funded largely by debt. Today, the brothers live in a complex of five newly built mansions that can only be glimpsed from their leafy Blackburn street as they are nestled behind high walls and security gates, with views of the nearby countryside and access to a pool, cinema and private prayer rooms. Just down the road, the brothers, whose parents came to the UK from India in the 1960s to work in the textile industry, are financing the building of a new mosque. They also reportedly own a £25m London mansion and used interest-free loans from EG Group to buy two Bombardier private jets. Having weathered a pandemic and a cost of living crisis since announcing their triumphant Asda deal, acquired with the help of their private equity partner TDR Capital, the brothers may be wondering about the state of their fortune. Asda’s sales flatlined last year at £20bn, while underlying profits fell to £886m from £1.2bn the previous year – and debts continue to mount. Debt millstone As Asda battles high cost inflation on wages, energy and wholesale food prices, rocketing interest rates have added to the pressure. With debt markets tight, the Issas and TDR Capital are being forced to plough £450m more cash into Asda to fund a takeover of their EG Group’s UK and Irish forecourts as they battle with the climbing cost of servicing a £7.4bn debt pile, including leaseholds, at Asda, according to credit rating agency Moody’s, and even bigger borrowings at EG. It is the supermarket escalator they don’t want to be on. Having already built a reputation as masters of debt-fuelled deals at EG, the Issas put just £100m of cash into the initial Asda deal, matched by £100m more from TDR Capital. The rest of the buyout was funded with the largest sterling corporate bond sale on record, according to Bloomberg, as well as a loan from the parent company of EG Group. The £1.7bn sale and leaseback of Asda’s warehouse network in 2021 was another key part of the financing. Finally, Walmart has kept a £500m stake in the Jersey-based business, which it had the right to hold for seven years along with a seat on Asda’s board. The Issa takeover doubled Asda’s debts, according to the Fitch rating agency. Structured right at the end of the low-interest era that began after the 2008 global financial crisis, the business has come under increasing strain, as its debts and the cost of servicing them has risen. By last year, Asda’s annual interest bill, including lease liabilities, had shot up to £300m from £90m in 2021, according to Amarveer Singh, an analyst at CreditSights. It is likely to be more than £400m this year. Next year, Asda’s total interest bill will probably rise again, by up to £90m, according to Singh, after the group added almost £800m of new debt to its balance sheet to fund the EG forecourts acquisition, all at a high interest rate of about 12% or more, according to CreditSights. One industry insider believes that almost £2m a week of extra payments will be like “a noose around the neck of the business”. However, while the group’s total debts will rise as a result of the EG forecourts deal, Asda’s debt-to-profit ratio is expected to improve with the acquisition. Accounts for Bellis Finco, the Asda holding company, show gross cash generation from operations of £1.6bn in 2022. The hope is that the acquisition of more than 120 Co-op petrol forecourt stores, agreed last year, and the addition of 350 stores that make up EG’s UK and Irish forecourts operation will bring additional profits and property assets into the business and boost its position in the faster-growing convenience store sector, where Asda to date has little presence. The retailer says comparison of debt holdings now with the days of Walmart’s ownership is not appropriate and it has a “sustainable capital structure, strong cash generation and clear strategy to grow [underlying profits], which, all combined, will enable the supermarket to reduce its debt over time”. In the background is a long-running legal battle in which mainly female shop workers say they are underpaid compared with their largely male equivalents in warehouses, which could result in more than £1bn in compensation payments for workers. Walmart has said it will pick up at least part of the tab. Asda says it will continue to defend against the claims “as retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and rates of pay”. An Asda spokesperson said the costs were “theoretical” as the case was still continuing. With Asda’s debt burden now significantly more onerous than its two bigger competitors – Tesco and Sainsbury’s – Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, says the Issas appear to be “having to take decisions they didn’t want to”. Financial engineering The Issas have sought a variety of ways to raise cash to support Asda and reduce its debts, including selling core property assets. A £650m deal to sell – and lease back – about 25 supermarkets to US-based company Realty Income Corporation was finalised in late July. Analysts at CreditSights estimate the group will have to pay an extra £67m in rent as a result, although it will have extra cash flow from the EG forecourts. Next up at the checkout is the sale of ground leases on as many as 30 Asda stores to raise at least £300m. The transaction would reduce its rent on those stores to well below market rates, but mean they are subject to much longer than usual leases – more than 50 years – making it hard to move out of or sell the property without huge financial penalties. The Issas also expect to find £100m of savings from bashing together EG’s petrol forecourts and the Asda chain – much of which is likely to come from ensuring each business’s suppliers give their best deals to the combined group. Some head office job cuts may be on the way, but insiders do not believe the two groups’ HQs – in Leeds and Blackburn – will be merged in the short term, as the trip over the Pennines would prompt hundreds of experienced staff to exit. The group has ambitions to expand, searching for at least six new supermarkets of between 25,000 sq ft and 60,000 sq ft and hundreds more convenience stores, according to property sources. However, Black claims Asda’s projections on spending during these tough times indicate it is “not backing up [that ambition] with investment”. An Asda spokesperson said: “Asda’s owners are committed to the long-term growth of the business and are investing in both supporting customers and colleagues during the immediate cost of living crisis as well as growing a strong sustainable business with clear strategy for the long term.” Less competitive Back at the tills, shoppers complain of higher prices – especially on petrol – fewer staff and reduced choice on the shelves. Outside Asda’s flagship outlet in Pudsey, Leeds, one customer points to what he calls “extreme rises” and says: “You can’t stick 40p on an 85p pack of biscuits!” Others say they regularly visit the discounters or Morrisons in search of a better deal. Consumer group Which? puts inflation at Asda ahead of all the traditional supermarkets, with price rises of 27% between June 2021 and this June compared with an average of 22% at Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Waitrose. Of the main chains, only Aldi and Lidl increased prices faster, hitting 35% over the period. As its price position has weakened, Asda, which made its name as the cut-price champion, where shoppers could pick up everything from bananas to babygrows, is losing market share. Its slice has slipped to 14.2%, from 15% in October 2020 when the takeover was announced. During the same period, bigger rival Tesco has gained share and Sainsbury’s held steady, with only Morrisons performing worse. The chain is also under fire from MPs for taking bigger profits from petrol after a competition watchdog found it had put the brakes on price cuts when wholesale oil prices fell. Asda was handed £60,000 in fines from the competition watchdog for failing to provide requested information to the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) fuel inquiry in a timely manner, though the company did later provide the CMA with the information. The company says its fuel strategy is unchanged in that it intends to be the “price leader” in the market but it is understood to have increased its profit margins on fuel between 2021 and 2022 to invest more in its grocery offer. “Despite record inflation, we have carefully managed our business to ensure Asda was the cheapest traditional supermarket for both groceries and fuel throughout the period reviewed by the CMA and this position is unchanged,” an Asda spokesperson said. Meanwhile, a number of senior executives have left Asda House in Leeds after losing out on regular share bonuses offered by Walmart and balking at the entrepreneurial style of Mohsin Issa, who likes to personally handle supplier negotiations in some cases. Asda said it has also brought new people in. One former staffer describes the new regime as “pretty brutal”, claiming that staff in some head office departments have been “cleared out”. “When Asda was owned by Walmart, it was very process-driven. Things could be really tedious with lots of paperwork and forms to fill in, committee after committee. The brothers came in and dismantled the process and really sped things up. Either you take to it or you don’t,” the former staffer claims. Another recalls the 1990s before Asda’s rescue from near bankruptcy by Archie Norman, now chairman of Marks & Spencer. “A load of people love the entrepreneurial spirit of the Issas, but plenty of people really see it was debt that nearly got Asda in the early 90s.” He says those people are nervous about what they see as errors in rapid dealmaking after “a lot of years of not taking any risks”. Some industry insiders praise the Issas’ quick thinking, for example, in bringing in the cut-price essentials range as Asda’s shoppers struggled with the cost of living crisis. Critics, however, say Asda’s market share stability is largely thanks to the greater struggles of smaller rival Morrisons. The brothers have brought in some strong retail nous with Chris Comerford, the new commercial director, who joined from Tesco. But Mohsin Issa has been running the chain himself since the departure of chief executive Roger Burnley in August 2021 as a long search for a replacement continues. With no experience in running a big supermarket chain the Issas have fared reasonably well so far. But one industry insider warns: “When you have wafer-thin margins it can start getting wrong quickly”.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/26/bumpy-ride-for-billionaire-brothers-who-banked-on-asdas-success,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1b0650bd0a2b9205518849dbbce27b7db17648/258_104_2210_1326/master/2210.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZ,2023-08-26 17:00:41,Sarah Butler,en,gb,0.136
139879525,Rating the Progress of Myanmar’s Resistance Movement – The Diplomat,"On May 5, 2021, Myanmar’s parallel government, the National Unity Government (NUG), established its armed wing, the People’s Defense Force (PDF), with the aim of overthrowing the military regime that seized power in a coup on February 1, 2021. Led by members of the ousted National League for Democracy (NLD) government, the NUG has built a strong military partnership with four long-standing ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) known as the K3C: the Kachin Independence Organization (K), the Karen National Union, the Karenni National Progressive Party, and the Chin National Front. The NUG is also collaborating less visibly with other EAOs, mostly those that enjoy close ties to China. Though the military still controls the country’s major cities and assets after two years of battle, resistance groups have slowly taken control of territory, including border areas and some towns in ethnic states, in addition to the territories that have long been under the control of allied EAOs. As territorial competition has intensified, so have human rights breaches and humanitarian crises. As of July 30, the United Nations estimated that there were now 1.9 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Myanmar, 1.59 million of whom had been displaced since the coup. On the human rights front, a local NGO reported that 3,850 civilians had been killed for opposing the junta; at least 24,100 had been arrested, of whom 158 had been sentenced to death. In addition, approximately 70,324 houses and buildings had been torched by the military as of May 31. In fact, all those numbers mostly represent open sources and Myanmar military abuses, not counting opposition violations, which were of course relatively insignificant. What the current political climate suggests is that the country’s struggle will not end anytime soon. Throughout the world’s history, different factors have contributed to the success or failure of armed revolutions, and this article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the current resistance movement in five key areas. Public Support (10/10) In the aftermath of the coup, the Myanmar military, known as Tatmadaw, offered certain positions to ethnic-based political parties in the newly-formed administration in order to mitigate the political unrest in ethnic states, while anticipating anti-coup protests in the country’s Burman majority regions. The calculation was totally wrong, as the regime’s spokesperson later admitted in a media interview, as the initial protests against the military takeover evolved into a nationwide uprising. The Tatmadaw was brutal in cracking down on peaceful protestors, and yet the public continued to resist it by organizing nationwide silent protests (or uprisings) on specific days, banging pots and pans every night during a specific period, boycotting military businesses, and initiating social punishment against military associates. The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) has rapidly evolved into a resistance platform for civil servants, including security forces, and the NUG claims that the number of state workers who had joined the movement reached 360,000 in mid-2021. The movement drew international attention, even being nominated for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. Even when the anti-coup campaign devolved into a full-fledged civil war, the people, especially Burmese expatriate communities, continued to fund both the NUG and their own ethnic-based resistance organizations. The public’s support basically ticks all the boxes for the revolution to prevail. International Support (4/10) Just as the people’s support was an obvious strength of Myanmar’s revolution, international assistance and support has been on the weaker side. Following the coup, protestors called widely for external armed intervention to safeguard civilians from the Tatmadaw’s inhumanity, but it was utterly unsuccessful. Under diplomatic and economic pressure, the U.S. has played a leading role in coordinating sanctions, pressuring the Tatmadaw on human rights issues, and encouraging the members of ASEAN to move forward with its Five-Point Consensus peace plan. However, these efforts have been largely ineffective in preventing the military’s action and the U.S. has even failed to persuade its Quad partners – Australia, India, and Japan – to collaborate on a solution to the crisis. The passing of the Burma Act by the U.S. Congress remains the most significant gesture of international support, yet six months later, there has been no meaningful action or pledge under the Act. Meanwhile, the Tatmadaw has maintained close ties with neighboring countries, except Bangladesh, and imported at least $1 billion in arms since the coup, mostly from Russia ($406 million) and China ($254 million). A Strong & Charismatic Leader (6/10) An influential and charismatic leader is essential to uniting the populace, motivating followers, gaining international confidence, and waging psychological warfare on the enemy. The Tatmadaw was of course concerned about the anti-coup movement being led by a prominent leader, so it detained key officials and senior members of the ruling party, including the president, Win Myint, and de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, on the morning of the coup. Arrest warrants are also issued to NLD associate public figures, including Min Ko Naing, once described by The New York Times as the second most prominent opposition leader behind Aung San Suu Kyi. Though he no longer wields much weight in the aftermath of the Rohingya crisis, he was someone the public looked up to during the peaceful protest phase, but has surprisingly played no key role in the NUG. The current acting president, Duwa Lashi La, is highly praised for his honesty, social skills, and communication skills. However, with all due respect, his appointment was widely seen as a gesture toward the Kachin Independence Organization, the NUG’s most reliable armed group partner, to which Duwa Lashi La is reportedly close. Is it time for a new leader to emerge among the NUG’s trusted armed partners? A former U.S. Ambassador to Myanmar, Scot Marciel, once said, “a unifying, charismatic figure would certainly help a great deal, as would a highly professional public communications campaign.” Adaptability and Resilience (8/10) By its nature, armed revolution can last much longer than anticipated, and can encounter unforeseeable challenges. Therefore, resilience and adaptation to changing circumstances is crucial for survival and eventual success. The PDF- and NUG-affiliated Local Defense Forces (LDFs) were born out of the immense need to protect civilians from the Tatmadaw’s cruelty without receiving any international aid​​. The presence of well-established EAOs has been crucial in terms of providing technical and moral guidance for the PDF and LDF. With technical support and limited materiel from EAOs, these groups have grown in numbers, manufactured military equipment, built strong coordination, built an operational structure, and developed a military code of conduct. They have attracted defectors from the security forces, with or without arms, through financial rewards and promises of protection. They have modified commercial drones and employed them on the battlefield in a variety of ways, including taking security footage, transporting equipment, and dropping improvised explosive devices. Their fierce drive and endurance gives them an edge over their enemies, who fight for money and power alone. A Strong Chain of Command (6/10) The coup and its subsequent bloodshed led to the establishment of approximately 309 armed groups as of November 2021, the troop number in each group could range from less than 50 to more than 1,000. After failing to create a much-anticipated Federal Army, uniting the newly formed armed groups with existing EAOs under a coordinated and cooperated chain of command, the NUG created the PDF as a precursor. As of April 2022, the NUG claimed to have consolidated an estimated 50,000–100,000 troops into its armed wing, while more than 30,000 troops are estimated to be operating outside of their chain of command. As security analyst Ye Myo Hein stated in 2022, more than 100 LDFs, or around 25 percent, had joined the NUG. The obstacle to further mergers is the NUG’s inability to provide substantial aid. A few groups have refused to join for ideological reasons, seeing the NUG as under the NLD’s dominance. When it comes to military affairs, the NUG relies heavily on partner EAOs to set up an effective chain of command and reinforce its authority over PDFs. However, EAOs are also focusing on strengthening their parallel influence over PDFs or LDFs with technical support and arms supplies. Ye Myo Hein argues that “alliance politics in the resistance movement are still fluid and unstable,” though there are some improvements in military cooperation on the ground. Conclusion Myanmar’s decade-long democratic transition during the 2010s produced greater political freedom, economic prosperity, and a new educated generation, all of which have contributed to strong resistance against the return of military rule by any possible means. Resilience and determination are what have kept the revolution moving forward, in contrast to the regime soldiers, who frequently surrender or defect when faced with a crisis. As the revolution approaches its third year, financial hardship has posed a major challenge to the resistance groups’ continued expansion and even their existence. The passage of the Burma Act was widely expected to be a watershed moment in the revolution that would address its financial burden and help the NUG to consolidate more resistance groups under one chain of command. But the implementation of the Act indicates that it is mostly intended to provide moral support to Myanmar’s opposition forces. As things stand, a power vacuum will likely persist with no side able to fill it anytime soon, leading to increased violence and instability and a worsening humanitarian crisis.",https://thediplomat.com/2023/08/rating-the-progress-of-myanmars-resistance-movement/,https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2023-08-29-230450.jpg,2023-08-30 06:48:57,Lian Bawi Thang,en,us,0.229
141135649,Illovo Sugar Malawi invests over K635m in development projects for communities around Dwangwa Estate ,"Through various corporate social responsibility (CSR), projects, Illovo Sugar Malawi Plc has so far invested K635.4 million in development projects the company carried out for communities around Dwangwa Estate in Nkhotakota. This was announced on Thursday by Illovo Dwangwa Estate General Manager, McLean Debwe during the company’s CSR day that included site visits to several projects in the local community aimed at interacting with the members of the beneficiary communities. During the visit, the community members also had the opportunity to express the impact these projects have had and provided testimonials regarding the company’s collaborative approach to CSR. Debwe said the event highlighted the company’s commitment to working together with stakeholders to create shared value and build a thriving community. “Illovo Sugar Malawi (Plc) Dwangwa Estate CSR activities focused on five key areas: education, potable water, food security, health, and afforestation,” he said. “By addressing these areas, the company aims to contribute to the overall development and well-being of the communities surrounding its operations. “Illovo Dwangwa Estate has successfully implemented several projects while others are under implementation.” The tour encompassed trips to Nkhunga Hospital, Nkhunga Community Day Secondary School (CDSS), LUANAR maize fields, Majiga Primary School and Majiga CDSS where the projects are as follows: Health * Medical supplies donation to Nkhotakota District Health Office cholera response (K10 million); * Construction of security fence at Nkhunga Health Centre (K46 million) * Construction of mortuary & provision of a cold room at Nkhunga Health Centre (K40 million) Education * Construction of a fence at Nkhunga CDSS (K33 million); * Construction of a classroom block at Kaongozi Primary School at K53 million (in progress); * Donation of 1,300 desks to Majiga, Matiki, Ukasi, Central Nyamvuu Primary Schools (K100 million); * Construction of an administration block, teacher’s house & classroom block at Majiga CDSS at K244 million (in progress); * Renovation of Matiki Primary School at K55 million (in progress) * Renovation of a classroom block at Central Primary School (K12 million) Potable water * Drilling of 5 boreholes in Mlala (K20 million); – Repairing of 8 non-functional boreholes in Mlala, Mowe & Nkhunga Police Station (K10 million) Food security * Support to community farming — 270 hectares of land provided to Kakuyu Rice Cooperative for a community farming project. Costs to date for training and cooperative registration (K3.8 million; * Support to food security — 100 hectares of land for cane growing and water for Irrigation provided to the government through LUANAR for maize production. Reafforestation * Provision of 20,000 tree seedlings to Nkhotakota District Council (K6 million). Debwe added that through these projects, Illovo Dwangwa Estate is “demonstrating its commitment to sustainable development and social responsibility” and that Illovo Sugar Malawi (Plc) “remains dedicated to collaborating with communities and stakeholders to identify areas of mutual concern and create lasting positive impact”. “The CSR Day serves as a platform to showcase the progress made and inspire further collaboration towards creation of a thriving Malawian community,” he said. Illovo Sugar Malawi Plc is listed on the Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE) and Illovo Sugar Africa Proprietary Limited (Illovo), through Sucoma Holdings Limited — that holds 76% of the issued share capital with the balance of the shares being held by the public and other institutional investors. Illovo Sugar Africa is the continent’s largest sugar producer with extensive agricultural and manufacturing operations in six African countries — Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia. Illovo Sugar Africa is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Associated British Foods (ABF), in the United Kingdom while Illovo Malawi has developed considerable agricultural and milling assets at the Dwangwa Estate and at the Nchalo Estate in Chikwawa. Both factories produce raw and refined sugar with the Nchalo factory also manufacturing value-added specialty sugars. All Illovo sugar sold into the local direct consumption market is fortified with Vitamin A to help eliminate micronutrient deficiency particularly in children less than five years of age. Illovo Sugar Malawi spends K1.1 billion for the fortification program benefitting an estimated two million people and it is one of the country’s largest single private-sector employer providing direct employment for 9,000 people permanent, seasonal and casual employees and an additional 5,000 direct and indirect contractors creating a total of 14,000 jobs. Illovo is also a major contributor to the Malawian tax authorities through direct and indirect taxes. It generates valuable foreign exchange through export sugar sales. Many local industries are dependent upon Illovo for their viability and the employment created by these businesses provides an income base for many more families than are directly employed. The company further supports an estimated 5,200 smallholder cane farmers through various smallholder schemes. Last month, on the sidelines of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) summit in South Africa, President Lazarus Chakwera asked Illovo Sugar Group to diversify their value chain in Malawi to other crops for the benefit of Malawians and also the company. He had an engagement with Illovo Africa Group Chief Executive Officer, Gavin Dalglish at Da Vinci Hotel in Sandton, and after the meeting, Minister of Finance, Sosten Gwengwe told the media that Chakwera has been engaging the Illovo Group for the past three years to find ways of diversifying. “The main focus was on Illovo Sugar to diversify value chain to sectors of our economy in addition to sugar,” he had said. “Illovo is about 60 years old [in Malawi], but they have really done only the sugar value chain addition and I think time is now ripe with the Shire Valley Transformation Programme, which focuses on gravity-fed irrigation. “Illovo can be the main off taker of that water and develop a second value chain whether its cotton or legumes or whichever value chain that can be scaled to the size of sugar and I feel it is a win-win for Malawi and Illovo,” he said. On his part, Dalglish was quoted as saying they were looking forward to the completion of the Shire Valley Transformation Programme’s irrigation canal, which he described as significant, saying: “I think it will have multi-generational benefits and it’s a wonderful opportunity to create more value chains for Malawi. “We talked about growth prospects for Illovo Sugar in Malawi — in particular around the Shire River canal project and the potential it has to create more value chains for Malawi and the ongoing investment climate in Malawi,” he had said.

141880037,"In San Diego, Greenpeace Ship Hosts Film of Horrors, Targets Bumble Bee Seafood","Ten years after Greenpeace saw one of its ships seized by Russia, the same 166-foot icebreaker is docked at San Diego’s Broadway Pier. The mission of the Arctic Sunrise is less dangerous this time. Instead of sending activists to board a Gazprom oil rig, it’s launching an effort to hold major seafood companies accountable for alleged human rights abuses. The ship displays a banner: “Bumble Bee: Stop worker and ocean exploitation.” Bumble Bee Seafood, whose U.S. headquarters is less than two miles from the pier, is the target of a petition drive to “end modern slavery in its supply chain.” More than 50,000 have signed, mostly in the United States, the group says. Tuesday night, the Arctic Sunrise hosted a sunset screening of the documentary “Before You Eat,” a searing indictment of Chinese fishing vessels abusing (sometimes fatally) Indonesian crew members and the system that allows it. One scene shows a woman in silhouette, her voice disguised, revealing that her “manning agency” employer that supplies crews said it was happy to see fishers die — so it could collect on insurance policies. “This is the first screening of this film in the United States,” said John Hocevar, Greenpeace USA’s Oceans Campaign director, who briefly appears in the 100-minute movie. Before now, only Indonesian audiences have seen the subtitled film depicting wage theft, horrific working conditions, “we eat like dogs” diets and weak government oversight. An audience of 100 — including former Assemblywoman Lori Saldaña, other Greenpeace donors and reps of groups like Surfrider — sampled sushi and salad before the movie was shown on a big-screen TV. “We expect that we will eventually see this on a streaming platform in the United States,” Hocevar told Times of San Diego. “I won’t predict how many people end up seeing it, but it’ll be available widely.” The chilling film was shown on the ship’s helideck. It ended with captioned references to Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea and Starkist. But a Greenpeace spokeswoman acknowledged to the audience afterward that details in the film didn’t directly implicate Bumble Bee in the horrors shown — including a crew member’s burial at sea. Hocevar said the film showed “symptoms of Bumble Bee issues.” Bumble Bee, queried about the Greenpeace events, said in a statement Wednesday: Although we do not agree with many of the Greenpeace allegations, we do acknowledge that more progress is needed to ensure responsible labor practices are followed on all tuna vessels. The Bumble Bee Seafood Company continues to work within our supply chain, with others in the industry and with the Seafood Task Force to advocate for the responsible recruitment and treatment of all workers and to reduce IUU fishing worldwide. IUU stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. However, Greenpeace a year ago released a study that directly ties Bumble Bee, and other companies, to such practices. Asked for comment on the Bumble Bee statement, Greenpeace USA’s senior human rights advisor for global fishing, Sari Heindrich, said via email: Words are cheap, and for each day that passes with little action from Bumble Bee, fishers in the seafood supply chain work in brutal and inhumane conditions, and our oceans deteriorate. The incremental changes they are touting won’t produce real results in their supply chain. Bumble Bee must do a better job of living its claimed values by taking bold and immediate action to lead a significant transformation in the seafood industry. Some immediate and tangible actions they can take to prevent tainted seafood from being sold in the U.S. include adopting a robust human rights due diligence process aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, completing and publishing oversight of fishing vessels and practices, strengthening observer protections, and establishing a time-bound plan to phase out transshipment (moving fish catch to refrigerated vessels in order to extend voyage duration) at sea. On board the Arctic Sunrise, Hocevar was asked why its years of targeting Bumble Bee (now owned by Fong Chun Formosa of Taiwan) haven’t borne fruit. “I would say that Bumble Bee has invested more in PR than they have in solutions,” he said, “and so our goal at this point is really just to show them that it’s in their own interest to actually become the company that they represent themselves as and that … the way they’ve been operating exposes themselves to enormous risk.” Hocevar said the San Diego firm has resisted taking responsibility for what happens in its supply chain. “They’ve pointed to things like — on the cans that you can supposedly trace the catch back to the fishing vessel [source],” he said. But as the 2022 report “Fake My Catch” documents, “that doesn’t seem like it works very well really much of the time,” he said. “They’ve used things like that as a kind of a shield — you know — ‘there’s nothing to see here. We’re doing this thing which no one else is doing.’ Yeah. Meanwhile the practices haven’t really changed.” The Arctic Sunrise (sister ship of the more famous Rainbow Warrior) is visiting San Diego ahead of what Greenpeace calls a major global campaign to call on world leaders to ratify the Global Ocean Treaty and protect 30% of the oceans by 2030. Greenpeace will unveil a report next week “that will highlight the threats facing our oceans,” it says. “Fully or highly protected ocean sanctuaries, which can be established under the treaty, are a key solution to the ocean crisis. These sanctuaries provide a safe haven for marine life to recover and thrive free from human pressures.” After leaving San Diego early next week, the Arctic Sunrise sails to Long Beach, where Greenpeace will support local Indigenous groups as they call for the Chumash National Heritage Sanctuary off the coast of Central California. Meanwhile, Greenpeace leader Hocevar says he hopes the documentary that premiered Tuesday “resonates with people and moves them.” (A decade ago, the documentary “Blackfish” slammed SeaWorld treatment of killer whales and sent attendance plunging here and elsewhere.) With a rap song accompanying the closing credits, “Before You Eat” was executive produced by Arifsyah Naution, Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Oceans Campaign Lead, in collaboration with SBMI, the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union. Has the film been pitched to any major distributor — or broadcast or cable networks? “That’s the plan,” Hocevar said. “The plan is to have this widely available. … It’s just starting.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2023/09/06/in-san-diego-greenpeace-ship-hosts-film-of-horrors-targets-bumble-bee-seafood/,https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GREENPEACE14.jpg,2023-09-07 03:07:27,Ken Stone,en,us,-0.11
142222171,"South Korea, Indonesia up cooperation to cut supply chain risks, reliance on China","South Korea and Indonesia have agreed to strengthen their cooperation in economic security – a move that would aid U.S. President Joe Biden’s initiative to restructure the global supply chain that derisks and reduces exposure to China. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his Indonesian counterpart Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, had a bilateral summit in Jakarta Friday, where they agreed on collaboration in multiple security-related domains, including establishing a secure ecosystem to produce hi-tech materials such as electric vehicles (EVs). “We look forward to continuing to expand bilateral cooperation in future industries such as electric vehicles, batteries, and smart cities,” Yoon told Jokowi. “Indonesia, which is a liberal democracy with a market economy, is grounded in the rule of law, where legal rights are guaranteed. This makes it our key partner in ASEAN, in the Indo-Pacific, and beyond.” “I look forward to working with our key partner, Indonesia, to find ways to contribute to freedom, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” Yoon added. Indonesia also sees South Korea as an important partner, Jokowi told Yoon. The two nations’ move to deepen ties would reinforce the Biden administration’s efforts to solicit help from allies including South Korea to wean off the global supply chain’s dependence on China. The drive is further evidenced by the introduction of legislation such as the Chips Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which are aimed at pressing allies to decrease their dependence on China. Yoon has in April agreed with Biden in further strengthening the U.S.-led initiative to restructure the global supply chain in advanced technology. And Indonesia plays a pivotal role in realizing Yoon’s plan. As one of the world’s leading producers of nickel – a critical component for EV batteries – Indonesia has emerged as South Korea’s crucial economic partner that ensures its economic security. On Friday, South Korea and Indonesia signed a total of four memorandums of understanding (MOUs), including the two committing to enhance collaboration in infrastructure, research and development, industrial policy, and technology. These MOUs aim to foster and promote investments in key sectors, including automotive, petrochemical, electrical, and electronics while at the same time, opening potential opportunities to bolster their industrial and technological capacities collaboratively. A day earlier, companies of the two countries also signed 16 MOUs, including several that aimed to strengthen the cooperation on the supply of core minerals and resources, according to a South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy statement. “We will promote economic cooperation [with Indonesia] to develop future industries,” the statement said, adding that the two sides would establish a research center for joint technology development to bridge Indonesia’s rich mineral resources with the South’s leading battery industry. South Korean firms like LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Samsung SDI are in intense competition with Chinese rivals such as CATL, for a larger slice of the global EV battery market. South Korea’s trade ministry also noted that Indonesia was rich in rare earth material. That observation may indicate its interest to diversify its rare earth material imports to reduce dependence from China for advanced technology supply chain. Rare earth elements are crucial to a wide range of hi-tech equipment, ranging from smartphones, EVs to defense systems. China, holding a dominant position in the global production and processing of rare earth materials, has weaponized the resource as a strategic leverage in international politics. Over the past few decades, Beijing has invested heavily in consolidating its position in the rare earth industry, enabling it to control over 80% of the world’s output. It has effectively used its monopolistic production against advanced nations, imposing export restrictions as a retaliatory diplomatic measure. In 2010, during a territorial dispute with Japan, China temporarily cut off rare earth supplies to Japan, alerting allies to diversify supply chains.

142269441,The African Climate Summit: securing new trade and investment opportunities,"By Gita Briel The United States and European Union can do better to support Africa’s green trade potential As Africa embarks on its industrialisation drive, supported by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the realities of climate change are becoming more visible and acutely felt across the world. The continent faces an industrialisation journey unlike any other – it must lift millions out of poverty whilst adapting to climate change. The pathways to industrialisation will also be influenced by the transmitted effects of policies enacted elsewhere to mitigate climate change. The promotion of intra-African value chains is at the heart of Africa’s industrialisation strategy, aiming to develop deep local and regional links to secure greater value addition. The AfCFTA framework and its protocols seek to transform productive structures. Whilst the major players rethink their value chain structures in terms of economic security, for African producers these are being recrafted to reduce economic and environmental vulnerability. As highlighted by the African Climate Summit (ACS) in Nairobi, there are major new economic opportunities for Africa in view of the green transition: it supplies many of the critical raw materials inputs into required technologies. On the other hand, there is a need for greater understanding of the transmitted effects coming from mitigation policies in end markets, which, when combined, may induce a‘green squeeze’ unless African producers and exporters have greater capacity to adapt to changing norms and standards. For example, the European Union (EU), Africa’s largest trade partner, has implemented several measures as part of its Green Deal. These include a carbon border adjustment measure (CBAM), new rules for mandatory supply-chain due diligence, and a ban on imports of certain deforestation-linked products. Complying with these to access EU markets will require African producers to invest in compliance processes, traceability systems and greener production methods. Understanding what support producers require to adapt is needed to reduce risks of exclusion from existing value chains. With regard to entering new value chains, demand for critical raw material inputs into new technologies is rapidly increasing.However, the extent to which the continent can benefit economically from this situation depends on how much of the value addition in creating the final green technology products physically takes place on the continent. Notably, one provision of the US Inflation Reduction Act is a tax credit available to consumers who purchase an electric vehicle whose batteries contain a certain percentage of critical minerals extracted in the US or countries with Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the US. Concerns have been raised that Africa’s potential to benefit from the US energy transition may be limited since currently only Morocco has an FTA with the US. The policy is also seemingly at odds with recent initiatives such as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the US and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia –major suppliers of copper and cobalt, the two key input commodities for lithium-ion batteries. The MoU aims to develop “an integrated value chain for the production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries in the DRC and Zambia, ranging from raw material extraction, to processing, manufacturing, and assembly”. As a tool for supporting industrial development in the sector, the DRC and Zambia are working towards establishing cross-border Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to produce battery precursors, batteries, and electric vehicles. The broader continent’s drive to harness opportunities from the global transition towards green energy is also reflected in its ambitions to develop a regional battery and electric vehicle value chain. The AfCFTA Secretariat has identified the lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle value chain as one of the high-potential value chains to be targeted for promotion in their work programme. The effective implementation of the AfCFTA, which seeks to reduce intra-African trade costs and tackle barriers to investment and competitiveness, offers an opportunity to promote a regional approach to value-addition in the booming green technology sector. To underpin Africa’s industrialisation, the AfCFTA must be responsive to the challenges posed by climate change and the interventions that Africa’s trading partners are introducing to combat it. Efforts to harmonise the continent’s trade and climate objectives could be pursued by adding a Protocol on Trade and Climate in future rounds of AfCFTA negotiations. A more immediate approach is to focus on the current AfCFTA’s domestication process and ensure greater integration of the trade-related aspects of national adaptation and mitigation plans with the implementation of the AfCFTA protocols. The African Climate Summit is unique in that, building on the Paris Summit, it is calling for a more integrated approach to addressing the climate emergency. It is also continuing the advocacy for changes in how development partners work. There are several continental action plans, initiatives, and conventions geared towards climate change action and environmental protection. However, within these documents, links between trade and the environment are often not well-established. Similarly, interventions amongst development partners are not always well coordinated and need to be more in sync with trade policy developments.

142424633,"Bumble Bee Seafood Ghosts Greenpeace in Bid to Deliver Signs of 51,000 Signers","Greenpeace demonstrated Thursday outside the U.S. headquarters of Bumble Bee Seafood Co. next to Petco Park in San Diego. But the activist group struck out when trying to leave signs representing 51,000 signatures on a petition calling on the company to stop sourcing from ships they say exploit workers and oceans. “We attempted to hand over the large cardboard numbers and small black sign you see in the photos,” said Sari Heindrich, Greenpeace USA’s senior human rights adviser for global fishing. “When they refused to open the door, we took them with us when we left. We will follow up by delivering the signatures by email.” She said about two dozen people, including crew of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise docked at Broadway Pier, arrived at 10 a.m. and left shortly before 11. “We attempted to contact BB through the call box at their gate,” Heindrich told Times of San Diego. “We went up to the intercom, rung the bell [and] told them we had a petition to deliver.” The person who picked up asked the group to hold on a minute, she said. “We waited a couple of minutes and then called again, and they didn’t pick up,” she said. “Then the security told us that we needed to leave because we were on private property and he did not believe [Bumble Bee officials] would come out.” Contacted Friday via email, a company spokeswoman said: “Bumble Bee has no further comment on this” after releasing a statement Wednesday. In its own statement, Greenpeace USA’s Chief Program Officer Tefere Gebre said Bumble Bee has “positioned itself as a champion for sustainability and advocate for fishers, while also ignoring the very real suffering of the workers in its supply chain and the environmental impact of harmful fishing practices.” But Gebre said years of investigation by the Greenpeace network seriously challenge Bumble Bee’s claims. “It is unconscionable that fishers must risk modern slavery, abuse and even death while trying to make a living for their families,” he said. “Today, we delivered a message from over 51,000 people that Bumble Bee can’t ignore. Bumble Bee has the power and resources to do better for these workers and the oceans we all rely on, and we are calling on them to take action now.” The group says a 2022 investigation by its East Asia arm found that over 10% of the 119 sampled Taiwanese-flagged or owned ships that supplied Bumble Bee had previously violated Taiwan Fishery Agency regulations and were on their Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) list. Greenpeace USA says it discovered a canned Bumble Bee product at a Harris Teeter grocery store in Arlington, Virginia, that contained fish from the Da Wang, a ship it said U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently confirmed to have used forced labor. Heidendreich added: The issue of forced labor and environmental destruction in the Bumble Bee supply chain is a longstanding one. For more than a decade, Greenpeace USA has tried to engage Bumble Bee in discussion about the areas where they are falling short and how they can take a systematic, human rights- and science-based approach to addressing those issues. The corporation has repeatedly refused to even meet with us. For each day that passes without action, fishers in the seafood supply chain are working in brutal and inhumane conditions, and our oceans deteriorate On Tuesday, Bumble Bee employees were invited to attend a private screening aboard the Arctic Sunrise of the documentary “Before You Eat,” event organizers said. Greenpeace Taiwan’s Ocean Campaigner Yuton Lee, who was present for the Bumble Bee demonstration Thursday, said: “Bumble Bee and its Taiwanese owner, Fong Chun Formosa, are some of the biggest players in the global seafood supply chain. “They have power and influence they can leverage to make substantive changes in the industry’s notoriously murky seafood supply chain. But while their profits grow, they have done little to change the situation. It can’t be business as usual while people suffer. Today, we send a message loud and clear to Bumble Bee and FCF: The time to change is now.” Ahead of the march, Greenpeace USA invited senior Bumble Bee leaders to meet privately, the group said Thursday. “They declined the invitation, citing a scheduling conflict,” the group said. “They also refused to meet the activists to receive the petition.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2023/09/08/bumble-bee-seafood-ghosts-greenpeace-in-bid-to-deliver-signs-of-51000-signers/,https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BB3.jpeg,2023-09-09 02:47:58,Ken Stone,en,us,-0.41600000000000004
142898851,[Editorial] Supply chain risks,"China’s moves to place restrictions on two fields -- one on exports of urea for fertilizer and the other on the use of Apple’s iPhone for government workers -- have sent a chill down the spine of South Korean policymakers and businesspeople. Both regulations have not affected Korean exporters and consumers yet, but given the past case in which China caught the country off guard with its curb on urea solution exports, much caution and proactive preparations for export control on other items are in order. On Thursday, US media outlet Bloomberg reported that China has requested some fertilizer producers to suspend urea exports, which it says will likely restrict supplies and boost costs for farmers. According to the report, some Chinese fertilizer makers suspended inking new export deals in line with a state mandate on urea. At this point, there was no confirmation about whether the Chinese government officially pushed for the ban. The next day, Seoul’s Finance Ministry clarified that China has not implemented an “official ban” on shipments of urea by local fertilizer companies. A ministry official told reporters that there is no official ban on outbound shipments of urea by the Chinese government, citing diplomatic channels. The ministry official said only one Chinese chemical fertilizer company announced it would reduce its export volume, adding that the domestic supply of urea for fertilizer will be stable even if China goes ahead with an export ban. The ministry’s reassurance was aimed at easing lingering worries concerning supply chain disruptions due to China’s unpredictable restrictions on key items that Korea needs. In 2020, Korean automakers suffered a setback as the wiring harness supply from factories in China suddenly dropped. In 2021, China’s urea solution export ban hit diesel car drivers here, as its price shot up nearly tenfold. China’s signal that it may resort to supply chain control again should be taken seriously as Korea depends heavily on its neighboring country for key industrial components and raw materials. Some experts in Seoul warn that China is fully aware of the potential impact its ban on urea and other items have in Korea. The 2021 urea solution shock alarmed the Korean government and businesses over the country’s overdependence on China for certain items. Since then, Korean firms such as Lotte Fine Chemical and KG Chemical have reportedly built up alternative import markets including Russia, Japan and the Middle East. As a result, Korea’s imports of urea for fertilizer from China dramatically fell from 65 percent in 2021 to just 17 percent in the January-July period this year. Qatar and Saudi Arabia emerged as key exporters of fertilizer urea for Korea, accounting for 41 percent and 10 percent, respectively, during the cited period. Korea’s efforts to diversify its supply chain sources have made some progress, but it may be too early and naive to downplay China’s not-so-official restrictions on export products for some political and economic purposes. Even though Korean government officials confirmed there is no official restriction by China, it should be noted that China has often taken market control measures without any formal announcement, while prodding state and private firms to follow its policy. A case in point is when China had retaliated against Korean firms over the US THAAD anti-missile defense system largely through non-tariff barriers. China’s attack on Apple is less subtle, however. Shares in Apple tumbled Thursday after a report that China would expand its ban on iPhones for government workers. Foreign media outlets reported that officials at China’s government agencies and workers at state-owned enterprises were ordered not to use iPhones for work. China’s latest restrictions on the use of iPhones is part of escalating US-China tensions. The US already blocks public employees from using TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video platform, as well as products made by China’s Huawei, while imposing sanctions on semiconductor exports to China. The Korean government and companies must brace for more trouble ahead. The reports about urea export controls and iPhone bans suggest there may be more supply chain disruptions for Korean firms, which remain exposed to collateral damage from the growing friction between the US and China.",https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20230910000198,https://images.koreaherald.com/koreaherald/version03/www/images/share.jpg,2023-09-10 22:34:59,Korea Herald,en,kr,-0.244
144107269,"Control grocery prices or face new taxes, Canada’s Trudeau warns chains","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned grocery chains that they could be hit with new taxes if they do not take steps to control rising food prices. Trudeau said the heads of the five largest supermarket chains, including Walmart and Costco, would be asked to come up with a plan to address rising prices before Thanksgiving. Trudeau, who is facing questions about his leadership amid sagging public approval, also announced that sales tax would be waived for the construction of new rental apartments as part of measures to address cost-of-living concerns. “If their plan doesn’t provide real relief for the middle class and people working hard to join it, then we will take further action, and we are not ruling anything out including tax measures,” Trudeau said at the end of a caucus retreat in London, Ontario, on Thursday. Trudeau said it did not make sense that supermarket chains were making record profits at a time when many Canadians were struggling to make ends meet. “Large grocery chains are making record profits,” he said. “Those profits should not be made on the backs of people who are struggling to feed their families.” Grocery prices rose 8.5 percent in July from a year ago, well above the general inflation rate of 3.3 percent. Canadian retailers have blamed increased costs from producers and suppliers, driven by overseas factors including the war in Ukraine, for the rising prices. “Rather than casting blame where the experts agree it does not belong, the federal government should look in the mirror,” the Retail Council of Canada said in a statement on Thursday. “The government could take a number of steps to make food more affordable, including temporarily removing the carbon tax from farmers, food processors and distributors and cancelling [the] government’s planned plastic packaging targets that could increase costs to grocers by $6bn a year.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/9/15/control-grocery-prices-or-face-new-taxes-canadas-trudeau-warns-chains?traffic_source=rss,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2022-10-18T203827Z_75822878_RC2W3X9R75WL_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-POLITICS-TRUDEAU-1694738465.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2023-09-15 03:42:44,Apps Support,en,qa,-0.182
144348135,Industry keeps an eye out for UAW strike's impact on small suppliers,"DETROIT — Suppliers are closely watching the UAW's strike against the Detroit 3 and bracing themselves for financial fallout deep into the supply chain if it persists longer than a few weeks. ""There are a lot of small companies out there that are so crucial for the supply chain for the automotive industry that we should not underestimate the risks,"" Mahle CEO Arnd Franz said in an interview this week on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show. ""The negotiating teams at the collective bargaining process have to keep in mind that if we stop making cars, there could be quite a tremendous outfall on the smaller companies in the supply chain."" The automotive supply chain is already in a fragile state after more than three years of pandemic-related impacts on manufacturing and logistics, rising material costs, shortages of key components including microchips and reduced vehicle production volumes. Suppliers, particularly smaller ones and those at the Tier 2 and Tier 3 levels, have seen profits shrink or disappear entirely, even as automakers recorded some of their highest quarterly profits ever over the past few years. Now, the UAW's strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, if it expands and persists, could threaten the survival of many of those smaller suppliers that are critical to supplying the parts needed for new-vehicle production, industry executives and experts said. Even one missing component, no matter how small, could shut down an entire assembly plant. ""The smaller the entity is, the more at risk it is,"" said Laura You, a member of Michigan law firm Warner Norcross + Judd's automotive and supply chain industry groups. ""So if the [automakers] and Tier 1 suppliers are not willing to work with smaller Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers, the reality is they might not have that supplier anymore when the strike is over.""",https://www.autonews.com/suppliers/uaw-strike-has-auto-suppliers-edge,https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/strikephoto-MAIN_i.jpg,2023-09-15 22:00:47,John Irwin,en,us,-0.254
144969843,Tetra Pak Sustainability Report FY22: Message From the CEO,"As part of our continued commitment to the future and in line with our strategic ambition to lead the sustainability transformation, we have taken a holistic approach across five interconnected areas where we can contribute the most: food systems, circularity, climate, nature, and social sustainability. The year 2022 was marked by considerable uncertainty and macro-economic challenges. The after-effects of COVID-19 remained, coupled with supply chain issues and rising input costs. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had both direct and indirect consequences. Weather events such as record heat waves, droughts and floods also had a far-reaching impact in several countries. All these factors have affected the global community in different ways, especially with an inflationary environment that is driving food prices and the cost of living up, resulting in food insecurity in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, the role of the food industry has become even more important As part of our continued commitment to the future and in line with our strategic ambition to lead the sustainability transformation, we have taken a holistic approach across five interconnected areas where we can contribute the most: food systems, circularity, climate, nature, and social sustainability.- to feed a growing population sustainably. Being a leading food processing and packaging solutions company, we see ourselves at the forefront, strongly committed to support our customers in keeping food supply chains running, supporting the well-being and welfare of our employees and the communities we operate in, while mitigating our environmental impact. The current operating environment has emphasised the need for innovative and integrated solutions that can meet the scale and speed of change required to strengthen food security, decarbonise food systems and fight climate change, in a way that leaves no one behind. Therefore, as part of our continued commitment to the future and in line with our strategic ambition to lead the sustainability transformation within our industry, we have taken a holistic approach across five interconnected and interdependent areas where we can contribute the most: food systems, circularity, climate, nature, and social sustainability. Towards that end, we have been accelerating our efforts to help build resilient and sustainable food value chains that improve livelihoods, reduce environmental impact, and, ultimately, help provide healthy diets to the global community. For decades, our technology and solutions have contributed to making food accessible even in remote areas with insufficient cold chains, protecting the quality and safety of perishable foods, while extending their shelf life1. In parallel, we have been investing heavily to significantly enhance the sustainability profile of our packaging and processing solutions. For instance, we plan to invest €100 million annually over the next five to ten years in the research and development of packages that are made with a simplified material structure, to strengthen recyclability and increase renewable content, without compromising on food safety2. Additionally, we intend to invest up to €40 million annually to increase the collection and recycling of carton packages3 and support the ambition of upcoming regulations to enable a step change in the industry’s transformation. Decarbonising4 food systems is another critical priority, for which we have taken a complete value chain perspective – from working upstream with our suppliers on raw materials, decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our own operations, to working with customers downstream on the impact of their operations, sold equipment and end-of-life. Last year, we crossed a new milestone in our journey to develop the world’s most sustainable food package5, by testing a new fibre-based barrier with the aim to replace the aluminium foil layer – a first within food carton packages distributed under ambient conditions. We made significant progress in our net-zero journey and achieved 39% reduction in GHG in our own operations6 while our efforts to support collection and recycling helped send 1.2 million tonnes7 of carton packages for recycling globally. Furthermore, to manage and mitigate our impact on nature, we have been collaborating with our suppliers8 and customers to champion responsible sourcing practices, contribute to global water resilience9 as well as conserve and restore ecosystems10. We remain committed to respecting human rights across our operations and the value chain, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Maintaining focus on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) within our organisation, we continued to progress in several areas – improving women representation in senior positions and in leadership programmes; driving awareness and actions around fostering inclusiveness; initiating and accelerating various programmes to expand our DE&I agenda, going beyond gender and towards securing equal opportunities for all. In the last year, we responded swiftly through contributions in cash and kind, to situations requiring urgent humanitarian relief efforts, for instance during the war in Ukraine and the natural disasters in Pakistan, Syria and Türkiye. We are proud of our team and the stakeholders we work with, whose hard work, drive and passion have ensured supply chain continuity amidst increasing challenges, serving as an inspiration to us all. With a strong commitment to the future, we will continue to drive ourselves and others to work ever more closely and find sustainable solutions to the challenges we face as a society. After all, this is core to our purpose: “We commit to making food safe and available, everywhere. And we promise to protect what’s good: food, people, and the planet.” View the full FY22 Sustainability Report here. 1 https://www.tetrapak.com/campaigns/go-nature-go-carton/overview/foodsystems 2 https://www.tetrapak.com/campaigns/go-nature-go-carton/sustainable-solutions/packaging 3 https://www.tetrapak.com/campaigns/go-nature-go-carton/overview/circularity 4 Our decarbonisation efforts focus on avoiding and mitigating GHG emissions correlated to our products and company, and carbon compensation to balance unavoidable residual emissions through nature-based solutions and other initiatives. Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions combined were reduced by 27% compared to our 2019 baseline. Tetra Pak operations = Scopes 1, 2 and business travel, our value chain = Scopes 1, 2 and 3. 5 This means creating cartons that are fully made of renewable or re cycled materials, that are responsibly sourced, thereby helping to protect and restore our planet's climate, resources and biodiversity; contributing towards carbon-neutral production and distribution; are convenient and safe, therefore helping to enable a resilient food system; and are fully recyclable. 6 https://www.tetrapak.com/sustainability/measuring-and-reporting/sustainability-performance-data 7 For the reported carton packages collected for recycling we use, where available, official publicly available data from renowned sources such as governmental agency, registered recovery organization, nationwide industry association, NGO etc. reported on a regular basis using a consistent approach. 8 https://www.tetrapak.com/campaigns/go-nature-go-carton/actions/decarbonisation 9 https://www.tetrapak.com/about-tetra-pak/stories/sustainable-water-management 10 https://www.tetrapak.com/campaigns/go-nature-go-carton/overview/biodiversity",https://kalkinemedia.com/news/world-news/tetra-pak-sustainability-report-fy22-message-from-the-ceo,https://kalkinemedia.com/storage/uploads/large/1667303166_636106feec962_banner.png,2023-09-18 17:43:00,3BL,en,au,0.147

Combination and the Divestiture Sale to C&S will Create Meaningful and Measurable Benefits for Associates, Customers and Communities Agreement with C&S Includes Sale of 413 Stores, 8 Distribution Centers, 2 Offices and 5 Private Label Brands Across 17 States and the District of ColumbiaExtending a Well-Capitalized Competitor into New Geographies Agreement Includes Sale of the QFC, Mariano’s and Carrs Brand Names and the Exclusive Licensing Rights to the Albertsons Brand Name in Arizona, California, Colorado and Wyoming C&S, an Industry Leader in Wholesale Grocery Supply and One of the Largest Privately Held Companies in the United States, Brings 104 Years of Food Industry Experience and a Track Record as a Successful Grocery Retailer C&S Agrees to Maintain Collective Bargaining Agreements, Securing the Future of Union Jobs Merger Remains on Track to Close in Early 2024, Subject to Regulatory Clearance and Other Closing Conditions CINCINNATI and BOISE, Idaho, Sept. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ — The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) and Albertsons Companies Inc. (NYSE: ACI) announced today that they have entered a definitive agreement with C&S Wholesale Grocers, LLC for the sale of select stores, banners, distribution centers, offices and private label brands in connection with their proposed merger previously announced on October 14, 2022. The proposed merger will create meaningful and measurable benefits for America’s consumers, Kroger and Albertsons associates, and communities that both Kroger and Albertsons serve by expanding access to fresh, affordable food and establishing a more compelling alternative to large, non-union retailers. This comprehensive divestiture plan marks a key next step toward the completion of the merger by extending a well-capitalized competitor into new geographies. The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading health care and pension benefits alongside bargained-for wages. C&S is an industry leader in wholesale grocery supply and supply chain solutions, with a strong track record as a successful grocery retailer. Founded in 1918 as a supplier to independent grocery stores, C&S services customers of all sizes, supplying more than 7,500 independent supermarkets, retail chain stores and military bases. Grounded in its commitment to feeding families across America, C&S currently operates Grand Union grocery stores and Piggly Wiggly® franchise and corporate-owned stores in the Midwest and Carolinas. C&S is deeply invested in the communities where it operates, and this retail expansion will continue its long-standing mission to keep communities fed. Through its wholesale and retail operations, C&S purchases more than 100,000 products, giving it the ability to provide customers with the best product selection and pricing available. In addition to its franchise and corporate owned supermarkets, C&S provides end-to-end wholesale, supply and marketing services to its retailer customers. C&S also brings experience with the merger process, having been an FTC-approved divestiture buyer in prior grocery transactions with a strong track record of successfully transitioning union employees and their associated collective bargaining agreements. In anticipation of the agreement, C&S’s 1918 Winter Street Partners retail holding company has been established to ensure a seamless closing process. C&S’s depth of industry knowledge, financial strength and commitment to growing its associates’ careers makes it the right fit to ensure the divested stores, distribution centers and offices grow and thrive for years to come. “Following the announcement of our proposed merger with Albertsons Cos., we embarked on a robust and thoughtful process to identify a well-capitalized buyer who will operate as a fierce competitor and ensure divested stores and their associates will continue serving their communities in the ways they do today. C&S achieves all these objectives,” said Rodney McMullen, chairman and CEO of The Kroger Co. “C&S is led by an experienced management team with an extensive background in food retail and distribution and has the financial strength to continue investing in associates and the business for the long run. Importantly in our agreement, C&S commits to honoring all collective bargaining agreements which include industry-leading benefits, retaining frontline associates and further investing for growth.” McMullen continued, “We appreciate our incredible associates who support and serve our customers and communities, and who help both of our companies succeed. C&S will offer exciting opportunities for associates to advance their careers – from frontline associates and store leaders to merchants and other professionals. We are confident the associates joining the C&S family will have an amazing opportunity to continue to build a thriving career in the food industry in one of the largest private companies in our country. C&S’s strong operational focus and financial resources, along with a comprehensive operational infrastructure included as part of the divestiture agreement, will position it to successfully operate and continue to grow these iconic brands for years to come. C&S is a values-driven organization that is committed to ending hunger while creating healthier communities – now and for future generations.” The divestiture plan fulfills the commitments Kroger and Albertsons Cos. set out in their original merger agreement in October 2022 with regard to divesting stores, including: Extending a competitor to new geographies through the sale of stores to a well-capitalized buyer that is led by seasoned operators with a strong balance sheet and a sound business plan; Ensuring that no stores will close as a result of the merger; Maintaining all current collective bargaining agreements, which include industry-leading healthcare and pension benefits, bargained-for wages, and ensuring frontline associates remain employed; and Committing to invest in associates and stores for the long term. Kroger took several steps to ensure a thoughtful and comprehensive divestiture plan. The terms of the plan support C&S’s ability to operate divested stores effectively and efficiently by providing: Strong teams, with deep industry expertise and the ability to operate at scale, and to drive growth and operational advancements in the divested business; A cohesive set of stores in each geography supported by two regional headquarters as well as banners, and private label brands with strong consumer recognition that will provide C&S with an established base on which to grow its store network; and A robust operational infrastructure, including distribution centers and offices to support both the immediate and long-term success of the divested business. “I have long respected C&S and its leadership team,” said Vivek Sankaran, CEO of Albertsons Companies. “I am thrilled that C&S’s outstanding capabilities and financial strength will ensure these divestiture stores can continue to grow and serve their communities as they do today. Most importantly, they have made a clear commitment to continuing to invest in and care for associates, including by honoring all collective bargaining agreements currently in place. I echo Rodney’s confidence in the bright future ahead for the associates joining the C&S team.” “We look forward to welcoming thousands of new associates to the C&S family and providing them the opportunity to build long and successful careers,” said Eric Winn, Chief Operating Officer and designated Chief Executive Officer (effective October 2) of C&S Wholesale Grocers. “As a leader in the grocery industry, we have a strong heritage of value and customer service that is enabled by a deep commitment to our consumers, employees and communities. Today’s announcement is another exciting opportunity for C&S to further expand into the retail market, which is an important component of our growth and future success. We look forward to providing a superior shopping experience that delivers both quality and value to our customers.” Transaction Details The divestiture transaction includes 413 stores, along with QFC, Mariano’s and Carrs brand names. Stores currently under these banners that are retained by Kroger will be re-bannered into one of the retained Kroger or Albertsons Cos. banners following the close of the transaction. In the four states where C&S will have the license to the Albertsons banner, Kroger will re-banner the retained stores following the close of the merger with Albertsons Cos. Kroger will maintain the Albertsons banner in the remaining states. In addition, Kroger will divest the Debi Lilly Design, Primo Taglio, Open Nature, ReadyMeals and Waterfront Bistro private label brands. The number of stores contained in the divestiture plan by geography is as follows: WA: 104 Albertsons Cos. and Kroger stores CA: 66 Albertsons Cos. and Kroger stores CO: 52 Albertsons Cos. stores OR: 49 Albertsons Cos. and Kroger stores TX/LA: 28 Albertsons Cos. stores AZ: 24 Albertsons Cos. stores NV: 15 Albertsons Cos. stores IL: 14 Kroger stores AK: 14 Albertsons Cos. stores ID: 13 Albertsons Cos. stores NM: 12 Albertsons Cos. stores MT/UT/WY: 12 Albertsons Cos. stores DC/MD/VA: 10 Harris Teeter stores The above stores (regardless of banner) will be divested by Kroger following the closing of the merger with Albertsons Cos. Additional Terms of the Transaction The definitive purchase agreement has customary representations and warranties and covenants of a transaction of its type. The transaction also provides a comprehensive operational infrastructure including eight distribution centers, two offices, five private label brands, and expert district, division and functional associates, to ensure C&S can continue to operate the divested stores competitively and cohesively with no disruption to the associate or customer experience. All fuel centers and pharmacies associated with the divested stores will remain with the stores and continue to operate. Subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including FTC and other governmental clearance, and the completion of the Kroger-Albertsons merger, C&S will pay Kroger an all-cash consideration of approximately $1.9 billion Prior to the closing, Kroger may, in connection with securing FTC and other governmental clearance, require C&S to purchase up to an additional 237 stores in certain geographies. If additional stores are added to the transaction, C&S will pay to Kroger additional cash consideration based upon an agreed upon formula. As a result of the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S, Kroger has exercised its right under the merger agreement to sell what would have been the SpinCo business to C&S. Consequently, the spin-off previously contemplated by Kroger and Albertsons Cos. is no longer a requirement under the merger agreement and will no longer be pursued by Kroger and Albertsons Cos. Merger creates meaningful benefits for customers, associates and communities The divestiture plan is another key step toward the completion of the proposed merger between Kroger and Albertsons Companies. The combination will bring together two complementary companies and create meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, associates and communities. The combination will advance Kroger’s Leading with Fresh, Accelerating with Digital strategy, which is grounded in Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. By doing so, the combined company will continue to invest in improving the customer experience and serving more communities across the country with fresh, affordable food. With a family of well-known, trusted brands, the combined company will offer customers lower prices and more choices for the fresh foods customers need, want and love – all with a seamless, omnichannel shopping experience. The combination will allow Kroger and Albertsons Cos. to unlock significant benefits, including: Advancing a Brighter Future for Our Associates. The combined company will benefit associates seeking to grow their careers. Kroger added more than 100,000 good-paying union jobs since 2012, and it anticipates continuing on this trajectory. The retailer committed to investing $1 billion in improving associates’ wages and comprehensive benefits post close. This commitment builds on the $1.9 billion in incremental investments Kroger made in wages and comprehensive benefits since 2018. The combined company has also committed to providing associates with programs aimed at continuing education and financial literacy following the completion of the merger. The combination will create a compelling alternative to large, non-union competitors. Serving More of America with Fresh, High-Quality and Affordable Food. Kroger built its business model on a foundation of bringing customers lower prices and more choices for the foods their families need to thrive. The retailer committed to investing $500 million beginning day one post close to reduce prices for customers in stores across the U.S. An incremental $1.3 billion will also be invested to enhance the customer experience. The combination advances Kroger’s work to make its products more affordable and accessible to more families, ultimately supporting a food system that will feed people across the U.S. for years to come. Driving Meaningful Improvements Where It Matters Most. The combination will create more opportunities to invest in communities across America as the company continues its journey to eliminate hunger and food waste. In June 2023, Kroger announced its commitment to donate 10 billion meals as a combined company upon completion of the proposed merger to families across the country by 2030. Putting this commitment into context, ten billion meals are enough to feed every person in the cities of Seattle, Denver, Chicago and Boston every meal, every day, for nearly two years. As a result of a strategic focus on donating surplus fresh food and charitable giving, the combined company will accelerate its ability to feed its neighbors and reduce waste, especially food waste. The merger remains on track to close in early 2024, subject to the receipt of required regulatory clearance and other customary closing conditions, including receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Kroger and Albertsons Cos. remain committed to working cooperatively with the regulators and all other interested parties to complete the transaction and unlock the many benefits it offers.

143570291,"Interview: China essential in Airbus' plan, says COO","TIANJIN, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- Airbus cannot achieve the grand production ramp-up plan in coming years without the support of partners in China, said Alberto Gutierrez, chief operating officer of the European aircraft manufacturer. ""I feel impressed and inspired about my visit to China. I was fully aware of China's achievements in infrastructure, connectivity, business, and development,"" said Gutierrez in an interview with Xinhua during his recent visit to north China's Tianjin Municipality. ""However, it's one thing to hear about it from my team's briefings and read reports on my desk and another to witness firsthand the incredible progress China has made. The level of capability I've observed here goes beyond just attracting investors. It assures a promising future,"" he added. The senior executive emphasized Tianjin's significance in aircraft delivery and customer relationships, underscoring the vital role played by the Airbus A320 Final Assembly Line Asia (FALA) in Tianjin within their global industrial system. September 2023 commemorates the 15th anniversary of the final assembly line's inauguration in September 2008, a significant milestone for Airbus' inaugural assembly line outside of Europe. ""It is realistic to local consumption, and we can avoid the costs by moving aircraft parts from one place to another. The key is to get the local support on site,"" he said. To this end, Airbus implements a ""local for local"" strategy and relies on the supply chain of China's aviation industry to support the development of Airbus in China. According to the data from Airbus, the company has about 200 suppliers in China. The total value of industrial cooperation between Airbus and the Chinese aviation industry reached approximately 1 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Nowadays, the partnership between Airbus and its Chinese partners covers the entire industrial chain, including procurement, production, and installation of massive parts, aircraft final assembly and delivery, aircraft operation support, aviation service cooperation, and aircraft recycling. Airbus also attaches great importance to competitiveness, sustainable development, and safety. ""We are extremely happy with our supply chain in China,"" Gutierrez said. With the support of Chinese suppliers, Airbus has delivered more than 630 A320 family aircraft assembled at the FALA in Tianjin over the past 15 years. Meanwhile, Airbus announced a global market forecast that more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed worldwide by 2042, of which more than 9,000 will go to China. ""It is giving us the confidence that China is the right place to be,"" he added. ""We will remain as steady a player in the Chinese market as possible."" Moreover, Airbus is preparing to enhance the final assembly capacity for its A320 family aircraft, adding a second final assembly line in Tianjin, expected to be operational by the end of 2025. By then, Airbus will have ten A320 family aircraft final assembly lines worldwide, including two in Tianjin, said Airbus. ""It will increase the number of units in Tianjin. China is in our plans to help us reach the global production rate of 75 A320 family aircraft per month by 2026,"" he said. Gutierrez believes that China has unique infrastructure, connectivity, business, and development advantages, which can further help Airbus expand its supply chain in China. China's dedication to sustainable development also aligns with Airbus's goals. Airbus inked a deal with China National Aviation Fuel Group Limited to acquire 3,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) over the next two years, bolstering Airbus Tianjin's operational requirements. Gutierrez expressed Airbus' aspirations to foster deeper collaboration with Chinese partners in hydrogen energy and biofuels. ""As a foreign company, we've been developing in China since the 1980s. We are extremely confident. Our investment will keep going, and our business in China is also improving,"" Gutierrez said, brimming with confidence.",https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/273964593/interview-china-essential-in-airbus-plan-says-coo,https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/story_logos/premier/beijing-bulletin.jpg,2023-09-13 09:58:59,,en,au,0.138

To this end, Airbus implements a ""local for local"" strategy and relies on the supply chain of China's aviation industry to support the development of Airbus in China. According to data from Airbus, the company has about 200 suppliers in China. The total value of industrial cooperation between Airbus and the Chinese aviation industry reached approximately 1 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Nowadays, the partnership between Airbus and its Chinese partners covers the entire industrial chain, including procurement, production, and installation of massive parts, aircraft final assembly and delivery, aircraft operation support, aviation service cooperation, and aircraft recycling. Airbus also attaches great importance to competitiveness, sustainable development, and safety. ""We are extremely happy with our supply chain in China,"" Gutierrez said. With the support of Chinese suppliers, Airbus has delivered more than 630 A320 family aircraft assembled at the FALA in Tianjin over the past 15 years. Meanwhile, Airbus announced a global market forecast that more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed worldwide by 2042, of which more than 9,000 will go to China. ""It is giving us the confidence that China is the right place to be,"" he added. ""We will remain as steady a player in the Chinese market as possible."" Moreover, Airbus is preparing to enhance the final assembly capacity for its A320 family aircraft, adding a second final assembly line in Tianjin, expected to be operational by the end of 2025. By then, Airbus will have ten A320 family aircraft final assembly lines worldwide, including two in Tianjin, said Airbus. ""It will increase the number of units in Tianjin. China is in our plans to help us reach the global production rate of 75 A320 family aircraft per month by 2026,"" he said. Gutierrez believes that China has unique infrastructure, connectivity, business, and development advantages, which can further help Airbus expand its supply chain in China. China's dedication to sustainable development also aligns with Airbus's goals. Airbus inked a deal with China National Aviation Fuel Group Limited to acquire 3,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) over the next two years, bolstering Airbus Tianjin's operational requirements. Gutierrez expressed Airbus' aspirations to foster deeper collaboration with Chinese partners in hydrogen energy and biofuels. ""As a foreign company, we've been developing in China since the 1980s. We are extremely confident. Our investment will keep going, and our business in China is also improving,"" Gutierrez said, brimming with confidence.",https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/273964841/china-essential-in-airbus-plan-says-coo,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/xih1694591110.jpg,2023-09-13 14:45:59,,en,au,0.129
144921855,"Publix, Florida’s favorite grocery store, explained","LAKELAND, Florida — The lore around Publix goes as follows: George Jenkins was working as a store manager at a Piggly Wiggly in Winter Haven, Florida, when he tried to meet with the grocery chain’s new owner to talk business and introduce himself. The guy blew him off — his secretary said he was in important meetings, but Jenkins overheard him talking golf. So he quit and opened his own store, which he called Publix, right next to the Pig in 1930. He built the business gradually, its growth mirroring Florida’s, and finally took the company outside of the state in 1991, starting with Savannah, Georgia. Today, Publix employs some 250,000 people across 1,350 stores concentrated across the Southeast. It is the largest employee-owned company in the United States. Its workers — it prefers the term “associates” — get shares of stock in the company after working 1,000 hours in a year. The line among locals is that Publix is a place where truck drivers retire millionaires, though it’s not clear how many of those are mythical creatures. Whatever the case, many employees are doing well, the Jenkins family is sitting on piles of cash, and the company continues to succeed. Its retail sales neared $55 billion in 2022. The grocery chain, with its bright green aesthetic, is arguably Florida’s most famous truly local major company. Disney’s a transplant, it doesn’t really count. Publix is deeply ingrained in the state’s economy and culture. Before Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi made his debut at Inter Miami CF, he made his debut browsing the aisles of Publix with his family. “Lionel Messi is already a Florida man shopping at Publix,” one headline declared. Publix’s acolytes talk eagerly about the store’s customer service and cleanliness, and rave about the famous deli sandwiches, known as “Pub subs.” Did you know they’ll take your groceries to your car for you? Have you heard about that one cashier everyone waits in line for? Have you seen the bathrooms, so immaculate you could eat off the floor? The reality around Publix, like every aspect of life, is, frankly, more real. The Pub subs are good; they’re also still just sandwiches, and the day I went to try one in Lakeland, Florida, where Publix is based, I waited for several minutes before a worker came over to take my order. He did have suggestions on what to get on the sub, though they were unfortunately delivered after I’d already ordered. The cashiers, honestly, do seem quite friendly, even if many people would rather do self-checkout nowadays. And I’m sorry, you really should not eat off the floor of any bathroom, ever. There are also the complications of real life — brushes with politics, labor-related controversies, a small-c conservative approach to business that has made the company slow to adapt, and the nagging concern that Publix isn’t exactly the most affordable. Still, to Floridians, the brand has a legendary quality. People often love their grocery stores — they can become endearing spaces of comfort and routine. In Publix’s case, that sentiment is on overdrive. Many Publix lovers have little anecdotes about what makes the store special. I heard about a birthday celebrated with a candle-stubbled Pub sub acquired from miles away, and about a beloved set of pilgrim-shaped salt and pepper shakers used every year for Thanksgiving. People recommended the chicken tenders sub, store-brand ice cream, and the chain’s “tear-jerker” holiday commercials. One man told me about how his parents — a cashier and a bag boy — met at Publix in 1985. When he was old enough, he got his first job at Publix, too. Javier Peña, a Florida transplant from the Washington, DC, area, explained he’s been converted to a fan. “I would joke that if you would ask Floridians what institutions they trust the most, Publix might be near the top,” he says. “It’s like a fixture in almost every community.” “Most people in this area love Publix,” says Barb, a Lakeland local who asked to withhold her last name to protect her privacy. She clarifies, “I mean, it’s a different company than it was when Mr. George was alive, but that’s going to happen.” “Mr. George” is how locals refer to Jenkins, Publix’s founder. Publix didn’t used to be open on Sundays or many holidays like they are now, explains Barb, who went to high school with one of George Jenkins’s sons. “People don’t seem to be disgruntled about it, they understand why they had to change some things,” she says, speculating it has to do with competition. Even if the company no longer rests on the Sabbath, so many parts of Publix feel old-fashioned. Its bakery still hands out free cookies to children, and if you want something on your Pub sub that isn’t available at the deli — say, mac and cheese out of the hot case — you can grab it from an aisle to get it put on. Workers will break packaging if, say, you only want two steaks instead of four. Blown-up pictures of the managers of each section hang throughout the store. In an era when it’s next to impossible to find an employee to help while you’re out shopping, at Publix, it sometimes seems like there are more staff than there are customers on the floor. There’s also a distinct level of continuity within Publix stores, not only across locales but across time. Publix today is supposed to feel fairly similar to Publix 30 years ago. Florida has a lot of stories of reinvention to it; Publix has been a steady, almost isolated force throughout. “They really have held to these small traditions, really forcing the employees to greet you when you come in, being extra assertive when asking if you need help with anything,” says Kaitlyn Dillon, a graduate student living in Miami. She grew up in Florida and recalls going to the bakery to get free cookies as a kid. One former Publix employee said he was told to always say “happy to help” to customers and never “no problem,” lest the implication be that the customer is a problem. That employee also recalled being told in training to say no if asked to join a union. A representative for Publix said they were “unaware of any training where this would have been shared” and that its workers had not “had a need for third-party representation.” Still, Publix has changed with the times when it needed to. It started allowing workers to grow beards in 2018, and last year, Publix started selling wine and beer for people to drink while shopping at select stores. When I toured a store in Tampa in July, multiple customers browsed the aisles with a plastic cup of booze in hand. I imagine it gave a little extra silliness to the interaction with deli workers, who were donning red, black, and white chicken hats for the day as some sort of marketing scheme. “Publix really has created this destination, and the destination is one part entertainment in the form of the atmosphere, and the other part is value,” says David Bishop, partner and research lead at Brick Meets Click, a firm that specializes in the grocery business. “In a routine activity like grocery shopping, it’s actually fun to shop at Publix.” In Florida, Publix is inevitable — many shoppers would have to go out of their way to avoid one. That’s not to say everybody shops there, at least not primarily. Publix has a higher price point than stories like Winn-Dixie and Walmart, and it caters to a more middle- and upper-middle-class clientele. Some customers will stop in for Publix’s meat and produce, for example, but buy other items elsewhere. People keep a close eye on Publix’s buy-one-get-one deals and coupons. For years, other grocery chains wouldn’t dare enter Florida for fear of competing against Publix. That’s starting to change. Kroger is establishing fulfillment centers and distribution hubs for online shopping and home delivery. This may be due to Publix being one of the early chains to partner with Instacart. “They’re really hitched to Instacart’s wagon, and that’s probably created some of the opportunities like Kroger to come into the market and actually achieve price superiority when it comes to shopping online,” Bishop said. “They are facing more competitive pressure today than they have in the past, but even so, they carry a lot of weight with their reputation.” Some of Publix’s efforts to innovate or try out new things over the years have petered out, including attempts to get into convenience stores and organic grocery stores. Much of its success has come in knowing its lane and sticking to it — hoping customers still appreciate that lane and others stay out of it. Jolyne Jurado, a homemaker in the Tampa Bay area, told me that prior to the pandemic, her family used to get everything from Publix. But amid some financial hardships and inflation, that’s had to change. “With Publix generally, higher quality comes with higher cost,” she said. Publix is for birthday cakes and charcuterie trays; Aldi and elsewhere are for more mundane items. Publix is a palpably visible force in Lakeland; it seems as though half the buildings and parks in town have been paid for and named for the Jenkins family or someone Publix-adjacent. It’s part of the town’s fabric and also its economy. “In Lakeland alone, Publix has millions of square feet of space, thousands of employees, from warehousing to manufacturing, from office to retail,” says Steve Scruggs, president of the Lakeland Economic Development Council. I met one woman in Lakeland who insisted she did not shop at Publix. Within five minutes, she was explaining how obsessed her son was with the subs. It’s here where I need to tell you I feel like people overplayed the sandwiches and underplayed the cake, which is spectacular. Also, an ethical note: A Publix spokesperson did offer me a free Pub sub, which I declined, but then we shared some of the groceries she’d pulled for me to try. I had a bite of a slice of cake, which became three bites, and then I took the whole thing. You can’t just return a half-eaten piece of cake. Publix doesn’t want to be everything to everybody, but it does want to be everybody’s grocery store. That’s meant trying to stay out of politics, which is challenging in a day and age where corporations are basically expected to wade into the hot-button issues of the moment. In 2020, it refused to let employees wear Black Lives Matter garb while on the job. Earlier this year, one of its bakery employees in Orlando balked when asked to write, “Trans people deserve joy!” on one of those spectacular cakes. They instead gave the customer extra icing and left a blank space so they could fill in the “trans” part, apologetically explaining they believed corporate policy barred them from taking a “stance” on something. Publix later apologized to the customer and said its associates should have frosted the cake themselves. Publix tries hard to avoid rocking the boat, so when it does find itself up against the wall, there can be a sense of astonishment. This makes even relatively minor tussles feel pronounced, though most customers I talked to were unconcerned or unaware of controversies. For more than a decade, Publix has been the subject of a campaign by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a human rights organization focused on migrant farm workers, to sign on to its Fair Food Program that seeks to ensure certain standards and pay for laborers. It’s rooted in Florida’s tomato industry. A number of companies have joined the agreement, which requires them to pay an extra penny per pound of produce, including Walmart, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe’s. Publix has not, and its refusal has been confounding to organizers. “It’s been surprising to us since Publix is local. It also surprises a lot of people that Publix isn’t doing it,” said Leonel Perez, a spokesman for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, noting that 90 percent of Florida’s tomato producers are participating in the program, too. Publix spokesperson Maria Brous said in an email that the company has consistently viewed the issue as a “labor dispute” since the campaign began. She added that the company works with so many suppliers “we could literally be drawn into a potential dispute between an employer and their employee(s) at any time,” which Publix doesn’t see as its place, and that it expects suppliers to follow the laws established to protect employees. In 2018, survivors of the Parkland school shooting staged die-ins at two stores over its political contributions to Adam Putnam, a Republican gubernatorial candidate and fierce defender of the NRA. “I wanted to make an example out of them because it was close to home and it’s very Floridian,” David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and activist, says of the decision to stage the die-ins, in an interview with Vox. “It’s hard to say you’re a family-centered company and you care about all those things when you’re literally endangering the lives of kids by funding these radical candidates.” Publix subsequently announced it would suspend donations to Putnam as it took time to “reevaluate” its giving process. (Putnam lost his primary to DeSantis,) People in Lakeland say Publix restructured how it handled government affairs after that. In 2021, 60 Minutes ran a segment probing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s vaccine rollout in Florida, including his decision to partner with Publix on distribution. The segment also noted Publix had donated $100,000 to his reelection bid. Critics of the decision say it took public health decisions out of the hands of public health officials and, due to the lack of Publix stores in low-income areas, complicated getting vaccines to everyone in need. Publix cried foul at the 60 Minutes segment, saying that the suggestion that there was a connection between the campaign contributions and the vaccine deal was “absolutely false and offensive.” Others, including some Democrats, criticized the segment as well. In a statement to Vox, DeSantis’s office pointed to its original rebuttal of the 60 Minutes story. That same year, one of the Publix heiresses, Julie Jenkins Fancelli, was revealed to have donated some $300,000 to the rally that preceded the January 6 insurrection, paying for what the Wall Street Journal called “the lion’s share” of the Ellipse event where President Donald Trump urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. Documents show she offered a budget of $3 million for Trump’s causes. The store has sought to distance itself from Fancelli, who does not have a hand in its operations. “Mrs. Fancelli is not an employee of Publix Super Markets, and is neither involved in our business operations, nor does she represent the company in any way. We cannot comment on Mrs. Fancelli’s actions,” Brous said in an email. “The violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 was a national tragedy. The deplorable actions that occurred that day do not represent the values, work or opinions of Publix Super Markets.” “Publix wants you to have an ideal civic experience in its store. It doesn’t cut corners, it’s not the cheapest, you go into its stores and it feels like you’re in a really nice neighborhood,” says Billy Townsend, a Lakeland-based writer and former member of the Polk County School Board. “They are going for a specific kind of feel, and January 6th ain’t it.” Among some Publix shoppers, Fancelli’s political donations do weigh. In my conversations, more than one person compared Publix to Chick-fil-A, the fast food chain whose politics have been cause for consternation. Most shoppers did not bring it up, however, and if they did, they shrugged it off. “If I boycott everyone, I wouldn’t be shopping anywhere,” said Lauren Goode, a Florida native now living in North Carolina. “It’s a bummer to hear about that, but then again, I look at my other alternatives, and I can’t say that I have a lot of better ones.” People talk about Publix the way I would the Piggly Wiggly (Publix’s original enemy!) in my Wisconsin hometown. My version would go something like this: The donuts are great, it’s too cold in there in the summer, and don’t go unless you want to run into someone you know. The versions of Publix I heard among locals in Florida were equally mundane: It’s a nice place to get steps in when it’s hot outside, if my husband had worked there we’d probably retire richer, the pharmacy workers at this location are jerks. Working at Publix seems okay, but it’s still just a job. One night in Lakeland, I ran into a pair of managers in town for training who’d been promoted at the store multiple times for over a decade. They were fine with their jobs, though both admitted they’d wanted to be teachers. Scanning through the Publix Reddit, you can see hourly employees complaining about their raises. Publix, like any company, is imperfect. The fandom of it is probably overstated, as are the detractions. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe we put too much on businesses to mean anything. We expect them to take a stand, but the reality is, there’s only so much they are willing to do — that’s the nature of capitalism, profits over politics. Disney wouldn’t have stuck its neck out on Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law if leadership thought the move would hammer its business, which it didn’t. Mickey Mouse isn’t some folk hero, either. Many of Publix’s customers want it to stay the same, but some of the external forces of competition and politics mean it may not be able to. It’s a tight line to walk. Publix seeks to remain uncomplicated in a complicated world because life is complicated enough. Keeping things simple may not be possible, but isn’t simple a little bit what we want our grocery stores to be?",https://www.vox.com/money/23862003/publix-fans-florida-politics-messi-grocery-store,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X6L0K4VXk5H0QSvzbs5sbqsy4o=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24918404/Publix_Final_PaigeVickers.jpg,2023-09-18 12:31:00,Emily Stewart,en,us,0.16
137847435,Exclusive-Rare earths magnet firms turn to Vietnam in China hedge,"HANOI/SEOUL : Korean and Chinese magnet firms, including an Apple supplier, are set to open factories in Vietnam, according to documents and people familiar with the plans, amid a push to diversify supply chains away from China and defend against Sino-U.S. tension. South Korea's Star Group Industrial (SGI) and China's Baotou INST Magnetic would join companies in sectors as varied as electronics and automobiles in shifting assembly lines against a backdrop of increasing trade restrictions, with clients even requesting the move, the people said. China is dominant in magnets and the rare earth metals they are made from. The magnets are central to the manufacturing of such products as electric vehicles, wind turbines, weapons and smartphones, making the sector strategically important. Even so, there has been only limited effort to challenge China's lead. Neighbouring Vietnam, however, has untapped rare earth deposits second only to China's, as well as a fledgling processing industry, giving the country the potential to be a much bigger competitor, industry insiders said. SGI's Vietnam project, for instance, targets 2025 output of 5,000 tons of high-end neodymium (NdFeB) magnets per year, enough for 2 million electric vehicles (EVs). Still, Vietnam produces just 1 per cent of the world's magnets, showed Adamas Intelligence data cited in a U.S. Department of Energy report, compared with China's 92 per cent. Moreover, some Chinese factories can produce 10 times as many magnets as SGI's project, and China dominates the mining and processing of the ores. Nevertheless, Vietnam's rise is significant. SGI's plant at full capacity would produce nearly 3 per cent of the 2022 global output estimated by Project Blue, a critical materials consultancy. That equates to nearly half of U.S. imports of neodymium magnets last year, U.S. trade data showed. Moreover, U.S. officials have signalled growing interest in Vietnam's rare earths potential amid discussion to upgrade bilateral ties this year, and South Korea signed a deal with Vietnam in June to boost its supply chain of critical minerals. Magnet makers are also drawn to Vietnam by low labour costs and market access afforded by multiple free-trade deals. They also want to move closer to Vietnam-based clients, such as automakers and electronics firms, which are increasingly wary of over-reliance on Chinese supplies as relations worsen between Washington and Beijing, industry insiders said. Vietnam is the only country beyond China with all stages of the magnet supply chain, from mining rare earths to downstream production, said a Vietnam-based industry consultant, who was not authorised to speak to media so declined to be identified. The government plans a vast expansion of rare earths production by the end of the decade and is boosting refining capacity, which the U.S. energy department estimated accounts for 3 per cent of the global share. However, ""anyone who is trying to build from scratch a mine-to-magnet supply chain is going to face a lot of challenges,"" said David Merriman of Project Blue. DOUBLING OUTPUT SGI, which supplies magnets to Vietnamese EV maker VinFast and Korea's Hyundai Motor, told Reuters it is investing $80 million in its new Vietnam factory with production starting in 2024. The plant would nearly double the company's current output of 3,000 tons a year from factories in South Korea and China. SGI described the investment as part of ""countermeasures"" against possible Chinese trade restrictions. ""China's policy on control of rare earths-related raw materials and technology is being strengthened, resulting in supply uncertainty,"" SGI said. It said it sources most of its rare earths from China but is seeking alternative sources in Vietnam and Australia and plans to develop a processing facility in Vietnam. APPLE SUPPLIER China's INST is set to begin operations as early as next month at a leased plant in northern Vietnam after gaining local approval in June, two people familiar with the plans said. INST, a large magnet firm specialising in circuit design, was added to Apple's supplier list in 2021. Its expansion into Vietnam follows requests from clients to diversify away from China amid growing trade tension, the two people said, declining to identify the clients. China's Luxshare and Taiwan's Foxconn are among major Apple suppliers who manufacture magnet-equipped products in Vietnam such as iPad tablets and MacBook laptops. INST's initial investment is limited to a few million dollars, with a possible second phase involving more spending for the building of its own plant, the people said, declining to be named as they did not have clearance to discuss the matter. INST did not respond to Reuters when seeking comment. A similar request from clients prompted another Chinese magnet maker, Magsound, to decide to open a factory in Vietnam in the first half of next year, the two people said. However, after winning approval in June, Magsound withdrew plans this month, registry documents showed, which the people said followed the collapse of supply deal talks with Luxshare. Luxshare and Magsound did not reply to requests for comment. Among magnet makers in Vietnam, Japan's Shin-Etsu Chemical has been expanding facilities this year after deciding in 2017 to double annual capacity there to 2,200 tons, showed company statements and details on consultancy Obayashi's website. Shin-Etsu and Obayashi did not reply to requests for comment. In April, Australia's Strategic Materials signed a deal with a Vietnamese refiner that committed to supplying rare earths for export to South Korea.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/exclusive-rare-earths-magnet-firms-turn-vietnam-china-hedge-3715396,"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--BYNV11Ue--/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/one-cms/images/2021-06/business_1.png?itok=rGtz_C8Z",2023-08-22 08:19:56,Project Blue,en,sg,-0.023
143100089,Investors Pressure Nike On Wages Allegedly Owed To Factory Workers - WorldNewsEra,"Youth activists who lined the streets of Nairobi last week to call for an end to major fossil fuel projects in Africa did not have much of a say in the agenda of the continent’s first climate summit. “The African climate summit wasn’t as much of a space for us Africans as we expected,” said Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, a 26-year-old climate activist who founded Uganda’s Fridays for Future movement. It was “absurd” that the summit’s host Kenyan president William Ruto did not demand more payments from the Global North “for the years of devastation they have caused on our lands”, she added. If Nakabuye had been in charge, three demands would have figured more prominently: phasing out fossil fuel production, asking western creditors to cancel debts and calling on rich countries to follow through on their repeatedly broken promise to provide more than $100bn a year for climate action in poorer countries. While activists may have felt sidelined, the urgent tone of their requests was echoed by the dozens of African ministers and institutions who called on western business, finance and lawmakers to do better by Africa. Over the weekend, world leaders at the G20 summit appeared to heed this call, agreeing to elevate the African Union to a full member of the group and calling for the World Bank to better serve low-income countries. Please read on for my story on what the business and finance world can learn from the Nairobi summit. But first, Oliver Telling breaks the news of an investor letter to Nike ahead of its general meeting tomorrow, calling on the company to resolve alleged human rights breaches in Asia. (Kenza Bryan) Nike investors dial up pressure on worker rights Earlier this year, we reported that unions and non-profit groups were taking Nike to task, alleging that its Asian suppliers had not paid money owed to workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now investors have entered the fray. Investors including $244bn Dutch pension fund PGGM last week sent a letter to Nike demanding that the sportswear giant “fulfil its human rights responsibilities”, calling on the company to ensure workers are paid millions of dollars that they are allegedly owed in wages and severance pay. The letter, which has not previously been reported, cites a study by investigative non-profit group Worker Rights Consortium that found 1,284 workers were dismissed in 2020 from one Cambodia factory, subcontracted by the Ramatex group, without receiving the remuneration they were entitled to. It also claims that workers at one Thai manufacturer, Hong Seng Knitting, have not been paid wages owed to them during a factory shutdown that year. Nike did not respond to a request for comment. It previously told WRC that an independent investigation found no evidence of its products being produced at the Cambodia factory in recent years, according to the campaign group. WRC also said it was told by Nike that internal and third-party investigations found no evidence that Hong Seng Knitting forced employees to take unpaid leave. The escalating pressure on the apparel company underlines ongoing concerns over the income lost by low-paid Asian factory workers during the health crisis, when economies went into lockdown and major western brands cancelled swaths of orders. The investors have not explicitly accused Nike itself of withdrawing orders. But their campaign also adds to warnings that multinationals should be taking greater responsibility for potential misconduct by their suppliers, amid growing regulatory pressure to monitor their supply chains. Decades after big brands started outsourcing production to Asia to save on labour costs, investors fear a lack of oversight is becoming a significant business risk. “It’s important that companies are preparing themselves,” said Richard Kooloos, head of social impact at Dutch bank ABN Amro, which signed the letter to Nike. “Companies prepared for future legislation are more robust, more future-proof and more stable for shareholders.” This year, a non-profit group submitted a complaint against three of Germany’s top carmakers, accusing them of using forced labour in their Chinese supply chains under a new law that penalises companies for failing to address human rights issues involving their suppliers. As companies face the growing risk of such cases, Kooloos warned that the business world was now “moving from a period of principles to a period of hard law”. He pointed to proposals in upcoming EU legislation that would require companies to ensure those affected by misconduct in their value chains have access to legal remedy. It is unclear whether the investors will force Nike to rethink its position. ABN Amro declined to reveal the size of its clients’ holdings in Nike and does not intend to restrict investments in the company. Only five financial groups have at present backed the campaign, according to people close to the efforts. But those involved are urging more to join as the company prepares for its annual general meeting tomorrow. They are calling on Nike to ensure that the workers affected are collectively paid $2.2mn. The US group reported a profit before tax of $6.2bn for the year to May. Elsewhere, it has been a good year for the Nike brand: film-goers flocked to see Air, an affectionate depiction of Nike employees in Oregon inventing the Air Jordan sneaker. The campaign on labour rights is yet to significantly dent the company’s image. But activists are hoping that the latest intervention by investors will draw more attention to the workers that Nike depends on, many miles away in Asia. (Oliver Telling with additional reporting by Arjun Neil Alim) This article has been amended to clarify that investors are calling on Nike to ensure that the workers affected are collectively paid $2.2mn, not $3.2mn as previously stated. ‘The finance gap is staggering: it’s trillions’ Global corporate and financial executives would have done well to pay attention to the goings-on last week in Nairobi, where discussions at the Africa Climate Week gathering revealed some interesting new investment opportunities for the business world. “The financing gap is staggering, it’s trillions, but you don’t hear about trillions coming into the continent, it’s just trickling in,” Hassatou Diop N’Sele, vice-president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), told Moral Money after dozens of African leaders and US climate envoy John Kerry had set off on planes home. “We feel the urgency but we just don’t have the resources.” As awareness of this financing gap grows, so too do chances to invest in Africa through public-private partnerships, with multilateral banks, states and philanthropic organisations taking on the biggest risk. A major aim of the three-day gathering was drawing in capital to fund clean energy and climate adaptation projects on the continent. Attendees pledged a combined $26bn in climate finance deals, including $15mn from the UK to mobilise climate finance from private sources, and €1bn ($1.07bn) from the EU to de-risk private investments into Africa. Green hydrogen, made using renewable energy, was a particular focus. Germany pledged €60mn for green hydrogen production to make fertiliser, while Hydrogène de France said it would invest $500mn in Kenya’s first green hydrogen power plant. And much bigger sources of risk capital for clean energy could soon be unlocked. One of the most tantalising is the $100bn in IMF funds (known as special drawing rights) that richer countries had promised in 2021 to redistribute to countries most in need. The AfDB’s Diop N’Sele told Moral Money that the summit yielded positive discussions with five major holders of this capital, over the possibility of the bank receiving these funds and allocating them itself to projects on the continent. It claims it could leverage each dollar into four dollars of low-cost loans to projects based in Africa. Another potential source of risk capital, export credit agencies, are under increasing pressure from their national governments to support climate deals, according to Irene Visser, head of strategy and international relations at the Dutch export credit agency Atradius DSB. Last year the agency invested €320mn in de-risking deals on the continent, and has supported start-ups including Spark, an off-grid solar company. Opportunities for green bond investors, who have had few chances to invest in Africa so far, also appear to be growing. The continent has been behind in sustainable debt issuances, in part because obtaining second-party opinions on the quality of green debt and marketing it to sustainable investors can be costly. But the EU promised at the summit to help shore up Africa’s green bond market by sharing expertise through the Global Green Bond Initiative. Tanzania’s largest bank CRDB announced a $300mn green raise ahead of the summit, the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. About 40 per cent of this will be bought by the International Finance Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank. Barriers to investment remain, in particular the challenge of supporting smaller clean energy projects, which cannot tap bond markets and struggle to attract risk capital from multilateral development banks or export credit agencies, according to Mark Napier, chief executive of the British-government funded agency FSD Africa, which promotes financial sector development. These challenges mean that some see local capital, not foreign, as the long-term solution. Just $830mn of domestic institutional and banking capital in Africa is invested in climate solutions and clean energy, a fraction of the $1.4tn assets managed by local institutions including pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds, according to FSD Africa and Climate Policy Initiative estimates. Enthusiasm for government securities, perceived to be low-risk, comes at the expense of investment in the private sector, according to Napier. FSD Africa has worked on creating private debt instruments which channel African insurance money into renewable energy projects. A similar model could be used to funnel institutional money from western sources into a mosaic of small projects.

143997037,N.W.T. store shelves filling up again after wildfires disrupted supply chain,"When Yellowknife's evacuation order went out last month, city residents had until noon on Friday, Aug. 18, to leave the capital. That Friday, Yellowknife Co-op manager Justin Nelson said his store was packed with shoppers from nearby Behchokǫ̀, filling their carts with weeks' worth of groceries. The Behchokǫ̀ shoppers were preparing for what would be a supply chain disruption that soon left some N.W.T. communities with empty grocery shelves and skyrocketing prices as freight came from Edmonton rather than the evacuated N.W.T. capital. ""They were the longest lines I've ever seen in the store,"" Nelson said of that busy Friday. Now that Yellowknifers are returning home and services returning with them, food retailers in the territory say their formerly barren shelves are stocked once more and that government programs are helping offset some of their additional costs. Dave Dyment is the general manager at the Délı̨nę Co-op. He says shelves in his store are once again ""pretty much full,"" but at the start of the month the store was in short supply, if not completely out of, milk, bread, flour, fresh meat, chips and cigarettes. ""It really did create some chaos with our supply chain,"" he said. In Łútselk'e, Co-op manager Joe Yatkowski said the store's regular shipments at their regular costs resumed Friday. Yatkowski had previously described barren shelves and freight shipments billed at ten times their usual price. Normally, he said, Łútselk'e would have received seven flights a week, with about half of them carrying the bulk of their food shipments. Throughout Yellowknife's evacuation, they received six flights total, he said. Yatkowski was so busy this week restocking the store with three planes' worth of supplies that he was only available to respond to CBC News by email. Government supports Nutrition North Canada, a federal program that subsidizes remote communities' costs on certain staple foods, is covering the increased shipping costs for affected retailers in the Northwest Territories. A spokesperson for Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC), the department that administers Nutrition North, said the program covered shipping costs for products like frozen and fresh produce, milk, eggs, baby food as well as fresh and frozen meat, poultry and fish. Spokesperson Matthew Gutsch said Nutrition North would be reimbursing retailers who incurred initial costs. CIRNAC did not respond to questions of whether it would be paying the full price difference between usual shipments from Yellowknife and temporary shipments from Edmonton. Dyment and Yatkowski both said they were informed about an increase in the Nutrition North subsidy but were not aware of details. About 4,500 kilograms of donated food and supplies also arrived in the territory this week to offset the supply disruptions. The territorial government partnered with Toronto-based charity Second Harvest, which is focused on food security. The charity sourced food from producers, processors and retailers across Alberta to deliver about 1,100 kilograms of food each to Behchokǫ̀, Colville Lake, Łútselk'e and Fort Resolution. Winston Rosser with Second Harvest said those communities were selected based on need, and ability to connect with leaders in those communities. Yatkowski said that he isn't involved with the Second Harvest shipments but that he's glad to see the supplies arrive in the community. He said in the coming weeks he plans get everything sorted to access supports that will help with the extra shipping costs. He also said he hopes to make plans in case next year's wildfire season puts them in a similar position.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-supply-chain-disruption-evacuation-1.6966155?cmp=rss,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6966175.1694697157!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/yk-co-op.jpg,2023-09-14 19:19:59,Justin Nelson,en,ca,-0.12

Speaking in Lilongwe yesterday when she presided over the handover of the supplies, Minister of Health Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda said the donation, which includes refrigerated vans and solar direct drive refrigerators, will help in constructing a fortified and resilient cold chain infrastructure for handling vaccines when fighting diseases. Chiponda (L) appreciates the package She said: ""We have received the donation through Unicef, but with support from the USA and Germany governments. The donation includes three refrigerated vans and solar-powered refrigerators, among others, that will bolster Malawi's health supply chain, ensuring the storage and transport of vaccines with maintained potency."" The minister said other tools in the package, such as bicycles, raincoats, gumboots and phone tablets, will also help health surveillance assistants in improving their outreach and efficiency, especially in remote areas, having come at a time when the ministry and its partners are implementing a series of polio immunisation campaigns in line with recommendations from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Unicef country representative Shadrack Omol said the supplies will enable the ministry to strengthen its health systems by providing timely, effective and safe healthcare services to its people. He said the tools will not only help in immediate challenges but will also ensure the ministry's readiness for future health crises. Said Omol: ""Imagine the workers riding bicycles, wearing raincoats, and using tablets to help people even when it rains.” Other items in the package include three refrigerated vans, 280 refrigerators, 6 000 vaccine carriers, and 100 000 water packs dedicated to effective vaccine management, 350 phone tablets to revolutionise real-time data capture and surveillance of immunization efforts.",https://mwnation.com/unicef-gives-ministry-of-health-k13-5bn-supplies/,https://mwnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chiponda.jpg,2023-08-22 08:58:05,Nation Online,en,mw,0.438
139775449,《TAIPEI TIMES》 Taiwanese investments shift to ASEAN,"2023/08/30 03:00 NEW DESTINATION: China-bound investment plunged 40.3 percent from 2018 to last year, while investment in ASEAN markets grew 40.9 percent, the economics ministry said By Crystal Hsu / Staff reporter Taiwan’s investment in ASEAN markets in the first half of this year surpassed the volume bound for China, as local firms continued to shift manufacturing bases away from the world’s second-largest economy at clients’ urging to avoid US-China trade frictions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said yesterday. Approved investments in Southeast Asia reached US$2 billion in the first six months of this year, accounting for 18.1 percent and overtaking China as the No. 1 destination at 17.6 percent, the ministry said in a report. It attributed the changes to a global supply chain realignment and rising Chinese labor costs. The phenomenon became evident in 2018 when China-bound investment shrank by 50 percent to the lowest level since 2010 and plunged another 50 percent in 2019, the ministry said. From 2018 to last year, investment destined for China declined 40.3 percent from the period of 2013 to 2017. At the same time, investment bound for ASEAN markets grew 40.9 percent, the report said. The bulk of investment in ASEAN was in manufacturing facilities, at 38.2 percent, followed by financial and insurance service providers （23.5 percent）, and wholesale and retail operations （22.3 percent）, it said. By contrast, China-bound investment was focused on manufacturing facilities, it added. Major local banks have set up branches in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia to better serve their Taiwanese clients and take advantage of fast-growing economies in the region. The government has also encouraged investment in ASEAN markets under President Tsai Ing-wen’s （蔡英文） New Southbound Policy to help local companies diversify investment risks. For the past decade, tech companies have increased their investment in ASEAN markets, whereas previously it was non-tech firms focused on the region, the ministry said. Today, electronic component suppliers make up for 27.6 percent, followed by vendors of computers and optical devices at 12.2 percent, textile makers at 8.9 percent and base metal product suppliers at 6.2 percent, it said. In the previous four years, base metal product suppliers accounted for 46.2 percent of investment in the region, far outweighing electronics companies at 24.2 percent, it said. India emerged as another big beneficiary of the global supply chain realignment, with outbound investment from Taiwan soaring more than threefold after the signing of a bilateral trade agreement in 2018, the ministry said. Investment in India this year might challenge the five-year average of US$100 million, it said, as India’s vast population has received increased attention from global technology titans and their suppliers. 新聞來源：TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎　 點我下載APP　 按我看活動辦法",https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/focus/breakingnews/4411607,https://img.ltn.com.tw/Upload/news/600/2023/08/29/phptHqtlL.jpg,2023-08-29 21:11:57,Crystal Hsu,en,tw,-0.278
138397089,North Sea&#39;s biggest producer swings from $1bn profit to loss after windfall tax - latest updates,"Harbour Energy is the North Sea's largest oil producer Credit: ANDY BUCHANAN/AFP via Getty Images The North Sea’s biggest operator has swung from a near $1bn profit to an $8m (£6.3m) loss after the Government imposed its windfall tax and bosses cutback on investment.Harbour Energy, which supplies about 15pc of the UK’s domestic oil and gas, said its half year results had also been hit by $16m of charges related to a review of its business triggered by the excess tax.It hopes this will deliver €50m of savings from next year.The business said that it had paid $437m (£344m) in tax during the six months, less than its tax bill for the first half of last year before the windfall tax on oil and gas companies was introduced.It comes a day after rival operator Ithaca warned it is being forced to cancel projects and reduce production because of the “severe impact” of the Government’s windfall tax. Ithaca Energy, which is behind the controversial Cambo oil field, has told investors it is writing $74m (£58m) off the value of assets as a “direct impact” of the Energy Profits Levy. Harbour chief executive Linda Z Cook said: “We remain focused on maximising the value of our UK oil and gas portfolio, advancing our organic development projects and disciplined capital allocation.”Andrew Keen of Edison Group said: “Harbour Energy has posted an anaemic set of results today, as January’s increase in the windfall tax on energy companies bites hard.”Read the latest updates below. Live Reporting Related Stories By Chris Price Save 24 August 2023 • 10:14am 10:14AM UK risks losing £65m in exports without switch to heat pumps, experts claim The UK risks losing out on £65m every year by the end of the decade if it does not speed up the rollout of heat pumps, energy analysts have said.Three-quarters of the UK’s boiler exports are to countries that have phase-out dates before 2030 and the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said the Government is jeopardising this income by not providing greater support to heat pump manufacturing.Using United Nations trade data, the ECIU said exports of central heating boilers roughly halved between 2019 and 2022 - from £150m to £85m - which they suggested may be down to countries moving away from gas boilers as a result of the energy crisis and aims of reaching net zero.Around three million heat pumps were sold in Europe in 2022, an increase of 40pc from the year before, taking the total to more than 20m, according to the International Energy Agency.ECIU energy analyst Jess Ralston said: The switch to clean heat is continuing at pace outside of the UK as the US and Europe learn their lesson from the gas crisis. It’s starting to look like we haven’t.The UK’s existing boiler manufacturers must be able to see the writing on the wall.With clear signals from Government on the future of heating at home, we can take our expertise abroad and get ahead on heat pumps before we lose our place amongst the leaders of the world’s heating industry. 10:00AM Putin addresses Brics following Prigozhin plane crash Vladimir Putin addressed the Brics summit in South Africa by video, the day after a plane crash that presumably killed the head of the mercenary Wagner Group.Putin did not mention the crash involving Yevgeny Prigozhin which occurred exactly two months after the mercenary boss led a mutiny that challenged the Russian president’s almost 25-year rule.Putin said: “We will continue the work that we started today to expand the influence of Brics in the world.” He tuned in to join his counterparts from Brazil, India, China and South Africa as they announced the bloc will expand to include Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from next year.

He said:Harbour Energy faces a very uncertain market environment, buffeted by a windfall tax that is set to remain in place until 2028, political back-and-forth over the granting of new North Sea drilling licenses, and a general ambiguity over the government’s climate policies. The company has thus sought to diversify into other markets – by, for example, investing in exploration in Mexico and Indonesia.

138616823,"Taiwan’s semiconductor sector faces offshore production dilemma as island struggles for water, power, people","A US$40 billion compound in the United States to be operated from 2025 by Taiwan’s flagship semiconductor manufacturer may help its hosts win a race with mainland China for chip superiority, but has the potential to undermine the tech-reliant island economy. Offshoring chip production could undo Taiwan’s semiconductor world dominance unless the industry solves a series of difficult problems at home, analysts said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chip maker, will operate the site in Arizona, while it also plans to expand into Japan and Germany. TSMC had a revenue of US$75 billion in the past financial year and its own network of lesser-known Taiwanese suppliers, but if they left, part of Taiwan’s economy could be affected. At the core of this question is TSMC’s ability to remain the unassailable leader of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing process Rupert Hammond-Chambers “At the core of this question is TSMC’s ability to remain the unassailable leader of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing process,” said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council advocacy group. “If that continues, Taiwan’s chip ecosystem remains central to the world’s commercial needs. “There are some challenges, however, that relate more to public policy. Water and land issues impacting new investment are real and need to be managed in a way that prioritises the needs of the economy.” After its chip sector took off in the 1980s, making Taiwan a magnet for customers including Apple and Qualcomm, it supplies around 60 per cent of the world’s semiconductors. But US President Joe Biden is aiming to expand the US semiconductor industry through the Chips and Science Act, which was signed into law last year. The law targets manufacturing and supply chains, with a focus on research and development. In July, Germany proposed a US$22 billion plan to improve its semiconductor manufacturing, as well as other elements of its hi-tech industry. South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy also said in July it had identified “specialised complexes” for semiconductors, with deregulation and tax incentives being considered. “The escalating trade tensions between China and the United States, along with other geopolitical issues, have prompted governments worldwide to recognise the importance of possessing their own semiconductor manufacturing facilities,” said Joanne Chiao, an analyst with the Taipei-based market research firm TrendForce. Taiwan can stay ahead of the US, Germany, South Korea, and mainland China even while TSMC and its suppliers move offshore, but only if it offers the right incentives for the US$150 billion industry at home, analysts said. Curbs imposed by the US and allies, including Japan, on chip-making equipment sold to mainland China have accelerated a tech self-sufficiency drive by Beijing over the past three years. In that vein, Chinese companies have stepped up development of components and equipment. But chip makers in Taiwan have little land for expansion, while a series of droughts have prompted a search for new water sources. We just can’t provide chip makers with a perfect environment to keep them Kent Chong The costs of imported fossil fuel, plus their potential greenhouse effects, further vex the industry, and a declining birth rate threatens to sap the workforce. “We just can’t provide chip makers with a perfect environment to keep them,” said Kent Chong, managing director at professional services firm PwC Legal in Taipei. During a drought in 2021, the government rationed water near a TSMC plant, but spared the company and other major manufacturers. A new Taiwan factory of TSMC’s scale would increase daily water intake by 118,000 metric tonnes, the Taiwanese news outlet Commonwealth estimated. It said that amount equals 7 per cent of Kaohsiung’s water consumption. Starved of chips, China faces ‘unprecedented’ pressure to become No 1 economy Chip makers, though, are unable to increase renewable energy because Taiwan’s electricity provider relies mostly on fossil fuels despite investment in offshore wind power. In March, the island closed one of its three nuclear power plants over public safety concerns. Last year, renewables made up 8.6 per cent of its energy supply, with 9.1 per cent from nuclear power. Access to power “remains dogged by under investment”, Hammond-Chambers added. ‘The right direction’: Taiwan seeks 400,000 foreigners for critical sectors A population decline that began in 2020 also has the potential to limit the number of engineers, with any solutions requiring “significant reforms to Taiwan’s immigration laws”, according to Hammond-Chambers. To secure power as Taiwan tries to derive one-fifth of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, TSMC said in April it had signed a 20,000 gigawatt hour joint procurement contract with a subsidiary of the Taipei-based ARK Solar Energy. More than a dozen TSMC suppliers are expected to participate, the firm said. On Wednesday, the Taiwan Water Resources Agency said an industrial park in the southern city of Kaohsiung would rely on recycled water to “assure stable supplies”. I think Taiwan’s government is very supportive of the whole [integrated circuit] industry Albert Liu TSMC’s Kaohsiung plant will need more water following “production adjustments”, the agency added. The government-run Taiwan Power Company last year approved an issue of corporate bonds of NT$18.8 billion (US$592 million) to stabilise power supplies with upgrades at three power plants. To plug talent shortages, Taiwanese officials announced last year they would seek 400,000 people from overseas, including 40,000 professionals. “I think Taiwan’s government is very supportive of the whole [integrated circuit] industry,” said Albert Liu, the Taiwanese founder of Kneron, a California-based artificial intelligence chip designer which employs 180 people in Taiwan. Taiwan has been deeply engaged in semiconductor manufacturing for several decades, and the formation of semiconductor clusters did not happen overnight Joanne Chiao Liu believes Taipei may offer support, including possible tax incentives. Other countries could take a while to build up semiconductor “clusters” with raw materials, equipment suppliers, chip factories and end customers, Chiao added. “Taiwan has been deeply engaged in semiconductor manufacturing for several decades, and the formation of semiconductor clusters did not happen overnight,” she said. Chiao acknowledged that “demand for talent and workforces” are among the most “crucial” issues. Torn between China and US, Taiwan’s chip sector may just stay at home The Industrial Development Bureau under Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs declined to comment. It, though, still might make more sense to allow the Taiwan chip sector to expand overseas, given constraints on the island, plus geopolitical pressures, analysts said. If mainland China takes military action against Taiwan, chip technology could easily be transferred to other locations with Taiwan-operated factories, said Chong at PwC Legal in Taipei. Mainland China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be unified, by force if needed. Relations have deteriorated over the past seven years. US officials have asked South Korea and Japan since February to apply for a cut of the US$50 billion that Washington has set aside as part of the Chips and Science Act to revitalise its chip sector. [A taxation deal] implies that Taiwan and the US will be more linked economically Hu Jin-li To help TSMC and its Taiwanese suppliers in the US, Washington is also discussing a deal to avoid double taxation with Taipei, a move which could encourage investment. “[We] welcome positive dialogue on the issue of double taxation”, a TSMC spokeswoman said in mid-August. TSMC owned 30 per cent of the world’s non-memory chip market last year, up from 26 per cent in 2021. “[A taxation deal] implies that Taiwan and the US will be more linked economically, making capital, investment, production, and people move more freely between the two economies,” said Hu Jin-li, an Institute of Business and Management professor at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei. “This is, of course, a gravity that economically pulls Taiwan to the US side.”",https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3232156/taiwans-semiconductor-sector-faces-offshore-production-dilemma-island-struggles-water-power-people,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/24/c15bcbdc-a1e1-4239-a788-c2206d3e13d5_6d2ed284.jpg,2023-08-25 05:00:23,Ralph Jennings,en,hk,-0.007
139622313,Is a global food crisis the new normal?,"When India halted the exports of non-basmati white rice in late July to control soaring prices domestically and ensure its local availability, the country had an explanation ready. The ban, coming from the world’s largest rice exporter, was always going to send panic waves across the global markets as dozens of countries, especially in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, depend on Indian rice. But India said its hand was forced by “high international prices due to geo-political scenario[s], El Nino sentiments and extreme climatic conditions in other rice producing countries”. The export ban affects one-fourth of the country’s rice exports. Coming soon after Russia walked out of the Black Sea grain deal amid its continuing war in Ukraine, the curbs on India’s exports threaten to trigger a broader food crisis. Yet, the ban raises deeper questions. Unusual weather patterns, geopolitical tensions and low yields due to climate-related factors are colliding with increasing frequency, leading to spiralling prices and mounting prospects of hunger. A searing heat wave in 2022 crushed India’s wheat production: New Delhi imposed a ban on exports that the world’s second-largest wheat producer still has not lifted more than a year later. This is also the second year in a row that India has restricted rice exports. Argentina, the planet’s biggest soy exporter and a top corn producer, has been suffering from its worst drought in 60 years, leading to sharp cuts in yields. Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of palm oil, banned its exports briefly last year amid rising prices, triggering a global scramble for edible oils, especially with Ukraine’s supplies of sunflower oil also disrupted because of the war. Brazil, a major producer of soy oil, has also suffered from droughts in recent years, while 2021 brought Canada’s lowest yield of canola oil in 14 years. So, is a perpetual food crisis the new normal? And what can the world do about it? The short answer: A confluence of extreme weather conditions, export curbs and geopolitical fissures could place the planet’s food security at perpetual risk. However, experts say there is a solution. Allowing free trade and using better varieties of crops that can withstand climate change better can help mitigate future crises. Growing export curbs Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world’s population and more than 500 million metric tonnes are consumed every year. India accounts for 40 percent of global rice exports, with other key players being Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the United States. The variety of rice – non-parboiled, non-basmati – whose exports have been banned by India formed about 10 percent of the global market in the last two years, Shirley Mustafa, a rice market analyst at the United Nations’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), told Al Jazeera. This rice “is destined to very specific regions, including Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal and Bangladesh,” she said. “Recently, African buyers have emerged as leaders in buying this type of rice, including Cameroon, Madagascar and Côte d’Ivoire.” But India has also introduced a 20 percent export tax for parboiled rice, in effect enforcing restrictions on all non-basmati rice – 80 percent of the country’s total rice exports. Such export restrictions destabilise the markets, Mustafa said. They lead to a price rise globally, particularly affecting poor countries who look to buy more rice fearing a supply crunch. To understand the demand for rice, consider what India did last year. In September 2022, India tried to discourage international buying of non-basmati white rice through a tariff to ensure adequate domestic supplies. But the strategy failed. Despite the tax, the export of this variety of rice from India grew by 25 percent between September and March compared with the previous year. Now, with India banning the export of some rice altogether, global prices have soared further. Rice prices reached their highest levels in July since September 2011, according to the FAO’s All Rice Price Index. “The price for Thai white rice, which is seen as the benchmark price for rice, went up by about 14 percent since India’s announcement,” Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, told Al Jazeera. But India is not the only country with export-curbing measures in place. In total, 20 countries have imposed export restrictions on major food commodities, according to the World Bank’s latest food security update, in July 2023. Afghanistan has banned the export of wheat, Bangladesh of rice and Cameroon of vegetable oil and cereals, while countries such as Russia and Uganda have imposed export taxes on some products like sunflower oil, wheat, barley, maize and rice. These trade-restricting policies have particularly surged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ‘Increasing hunger’ Prices of food staples like wheat, maize, rice and oil seeds have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 disrupted global supply chains, after years of relatively stable costs, Matin Qaim, a professor of food and agricultural economics at Germany’s University of Bonn, told Al Jazeera. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine made things worse, with global food prices at an all-time peak in March 2022, according to the FAO’s index. “We had not seen such increases since 2007-08 and 2011,” Qaim said. Before the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for 34 percent of global exports of wheat, 27 percent of barley, 17 percent of maize and 55 percent of sunflower oil. Some regions in particular had a high dependency on imports from these two countries. North Africa and the Middle East received 50 percent of their cereal supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s military blockade of the Black Sea port brought Ukrainian exports to a near-halt between March and July 2022 before the United Nations and Turkey brokered a landmark deal with Kyiv and Moscow to resume exports. More than 32 million metric tonnes of corn, wheat and other grains were exported by Ukraine between July 2022 and July 2023. But on July 17, Russia decided to not renew the initiative, potentially hitting Ukraine’s planned grain exports of 45 million tonnes by half. “I am concerned that some of the progress we have been making [in terms of food security] in the last two decades has come to a halt,” Qaim said. “We are now rather seeing increasing hunger numbers and this threatens to impact the sustainable development goal of ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.” About 9.2 percent of the world’s population – between 691 million and 783 million people – faced hunger in 2022, significantly higher than 7.9 percent in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, according to the FAO’s 2023 State of Food Insecurity and Nutrition in the World report. Amplifying that food crisis is a phenomenon playing out in the form of wildfires in Canada and Europe, drought in South America and East Africa, and floods in China and arid parts of California – climate change. Too hot, too dry, too wet As devastating floods swept across large parts of Pakistan in 2022, water swamped farmlands the size of the Czech Republic, damaging more than 80 percent of the country’s crops and pushing it into a food crisis. At the other end of the extreme weather phenomena the world is confronting with increasing regularity are Argentina and Spain, which have faced unprecedented droughts in 2023. Now, Australia is reportedly bracing for a dramatic 34 percent decline in its wheat yield this year, with the world’s fourth-largest exporter of the grain expecting arid El Niño conditions. Heat is also affecting the US corn yield as well as wheat production in Europe and Canada, according to the New York-based artificial intelligence-related agro-industry analysis firm Gro Intelligence. Kenya, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Chile and Bolivia are also expected to see lower crop yields due to the unfavourable weather conditions this year. To be sure, declines in production in one part of the world can, in theory, often be compensated by bumper yields in other countries. “Weather extremes do impact crop production but the impact is not symmetrical across the globe at the same time,” Bharat Ramaswami, a professor of economics at Ashoka University in the New Delhi suburb of Sonepat, told Al Jazeera. “The global food supply does not change much in the unaffected part of the world. A global food system can manage such shortages given there is enough cooperation between countries and we allow food to move freely.” While drought conditions led to lower wheat and maize yields in the US and in some Asian countries in 2021 and 2022, for instance, Australia reported bumper wheat outputs in those years. Yet, the free movement of food supplies Ramaswani advocates is today under stress because of export controls and geopolitical tensions. And the science is clear: In the long run, rising temperatures will lead to a decline in the yields of the most consumed crops, like rice, wheat, maize and soybean. What’s needed Both those challenges – export controls and declining yields – can be addressed, according to analysts. What is needed is a global strategy. Ramaswami said global food stocks have remained at similar levels for the past few years and the FAO’s latest forecasts, in June 2023, have actually shown a rise in production and stocks for basic agricultural commodities. “A coordinated action is required by exporters to reassure especially the poor countries that we will not shut off supplies arbitrarily and that their interests will not be sacrificed,” he said. “This will restore faith in the global trading system since world trade is vulnerable to political risks and perceptions.” At the same time, Qaim said that crop production systems must be improved and countries must use better and more resilient seeds, focusing on crops that are more resilient to extreme weather conditions. This, in turn, means that countries need to invest more in research and technology in agriculture. “With the right steps in the medium and longer term, the looming food crisis can be avoided,” Qaim said. Traditional climate-smart crops, which can withstand extreme temperatures, are slowly making a comeback. Millets, once a staple in Africa and many parts of Asia, have seen an increase in exports in recent years. The UN has designated 2023 as the International Year of Millets, with a slew of promotional activities aimed at highlighting the nutritional (they are rich in protein and micronutrients) and climate-friendly characteristics of these ancient grains. Meanwhile, scientists are developing drought-tolerant varieties of rice, wheat, maize and other important crops. None of these will replace the grain varieties currently used widely around the world any time soon, yet they offer a potential, long-term solution. It is a race against time – and growing hunger.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/29/is-a-global-food-crisis-the-new-normal?traffic_source=rss,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/story_35_final-1-1693276580.jpg?resize=1620%2C1080&quality=80,2023-08-29 06:43:56,Apps Support,en,qa,0.07100000000000001
137768985,Prices are up and the supply of things we need is in flux. How did we get here?,"This is the second article in The Conversation’s series examining Australia’s cost of living crisis. Read the first article in the series here. Australia is in a cost-of-living crisis. We know that because the prices typical Australians pay for typical products have been climbing much faster than typical wages, as acknowledged in the standard briefing provided to members of parliament by Australia’s Parliamentary Library. For most of the last century, and certainly for most of the past 20 years, wages have consistently climbed faster than prices, with minor exceptions in 2009 and 2014 when the difference between the two was small – less than 1%. But since March 2021 prices have been climbing faster than wages. When inflation peaked in late 2022, the annual consumer price index was climbing 4.4 percentage points faster than wages - a gap that has since shrunk, but remained at 2.4 percentage points in the latest figures for the year to June. COVID has played an important part. In the beginning, the pandemic brought prices down, and by a lot. Remember paying 80 cents per litre for petrol? In the first year of COVID, to the June quarter 2020, Australia went through its first year of negative inflation since 1997. That means that, taken together, prices actually fell. Fast-forward only two years, and the quarterly consumer price index hit 7.8% in December (and the more experimental monthly index hit 8.4%.) For those born after the 1980s, this was a first. Going from bottom to top at such a speed only increased the pain. It began with broken supply chains The acceleration in inflation began with a mismatch between supply and demand. Before COVID, the world experienced more than three decades of stability and high predictability in supply chains, thanks to an intense move towards globalisation. Countries became more specialised, industries and agriculture moved away from the United States and Europe, and manufacturing became leaner by using the just-in-time production model which ensured they met demand, but didn’t get stuck with inventories. This prosperity was based on the assumption that goods and people could move freely across the globe. Until COVID. Overnight, ports, railroads and trucks saw their operations slashed as people isolated. Air travel came close to a complete shutdown. With insufficient availability, transport prices skyrocketed. Then governments sprayed us with money Then there was a huge increase in demand for products as governments splashed around money in an effort to keep their economies afloat. Being unable to travel, dine out or get a proper haircut, people went online to buy bicycles, air fryers and hair dryers like never before. Online shopping accelerated faster than expected, with big waiting lists for items as diverse as cars, video games, pool chlorine and pet food. And supply was constrained by workers having to stay home. Factories couldn’t operate at capacity. Because different regions were affected at different times, and most businesses work with low inventories, “just-in-time” struggled. Parts, components and materials suddenly became scarce. For businesses such as abattoirs, health rules in states like Victoria restricted beef, lamb and pork processing to two-thirds of normal output. Read more: Floods, pandemics, wars and the market: what's driving the price of milk Too many people buying, not enough products to sell, and difficulty moving goods created an imbalance between supply and demand, which pushed up prices globally from late 2020 onwards. Then Russia invaded Ukraine In early 2022 just as the world was preparing to open up, Russia invaded Ukraine. The war triggered an energy crisis. Russia, a major global supplier of gas and oil, was driven out of several markets by international sanctions in what is a textbook trigger for inflation. In the first wave, petrol, gas and electricity skyrocketed. In Australia, petrol stations reflect changes in international markets in a matter of days. We paid $2.50 per litre at the pump. The second wave came as long-term contracts were renegotiated. Industries lock in prices with energy providers months in advance, meaning an increase in costs today takes time to make its way through the system. The third wave came as prices for parts, components and materials increased downstream in a domino effect. As an example, the increase in energy prices in early 2022 led to a rise in steel prices in late 2022, reaching home appliance prices in early 2023, and the price of goods sold in shops only in recent months. And climate change accelerated The pandemic’s disruptive effects lasted about two years. The war in Ukraine may go for longer, hopefully not. But the time span of both pales when confronted with something that will impact Australians for generations: climate change. One significant consequence is extreme weather. The Bureau of Meteorology’s report on the State of the Climate 2022 highlights the ongoing changes for Australia including amplified storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and blizzards with “one in a 100 year” events multiplying. Each brings disruption to supply chains, pushing up prices. Take the rollercoaster ride of an iceberg lettuce going from $2.50 to $12.50 due to floods in Australia last year. Now it’s back to about $3.90. Read more: Why is lettuce so expensive? Costs have shot up, and won't return Or the shortage of frozen chips due to droughts in Europe and floods in New Zealand earlier this year. Or the recent ban from India on rice exports due to extreme monsoons in South Asia, set to increase international rice prices above the 14% increase already seen in the past year. Supply uncertainty fuels inflation. Read more: What's driving the potato chip shortage and when will it pass? The move to renewables, which is fundamental to mitigating climate change, has a price tag attached to it at the moment. Net-zero targets require considerable investment by businesses as they move to green energy and materials. While there will be a long-term return, there are costs now. Preparing the factory floor against heatwaves (installing fans), floods (relocating sites), and disruptions (building inventory) drive up prices. On top of that, insurance premiums are on the rise, some becoming prohibitive. Yet there’s a silver lining This list of inflation drivers is not exhaustive as there are more forces at play, among them labour shortages, population growth and the housing crisis. But there is good news. Supply chains are more robust after the pandemic, evidenced by container transport prices going back to what they were in 2020. The world is moving away from fossil fuels faster after the invasion of Ukraine. Wind and solar energy are becoming cheaper at a remarkable rate, and there is promising news on hydrogen as a fuel. Business continuity plans to minimise disruptions in the face of extreme weather are stronger than before. Supply and demand should soon find a new lasting equilibrium. Prices will not go back to what they were, but there is every reason to believe the increases will be tamed sooner rather than later. It will be a welcome relief.

138288717,"Nigeria highly dependent on imported cars, drugs – UN","Nigeria is highly dependent on the imports of goods, such as refined petrol, cars, smartphones, cereals, and pharmaceuticals, the United Nations has affirmed. This was disclosed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in its recently released report titled, ‘The Economic Development in Africa Report 2023: The Potential of Africa to Capture Technology-intensive Global Supply Chains.’ This revelation comes as the UN opined that Africa could position itself as a geographic alternative and optimise its strategic value for future leading-edge supply chains as many companies across the world rethink their supply chain strategies to address gaps and mitigate risks, According to the UN department, Africa needs to play a more impactful role in the global supply chain and build resilience, especially because of its large consumer market. The UN agency, however, noted that an important precondition for Africa to play a more impactful role in global supply chains and build resilience to the disruptive nature of shocks will be to address its supply chain vulnerabilities. It expanded that the key barriers to logistics and supply chains on the continent include poor infrastructure (transport, warehouse and other facilities), informality, weak institutions and regulations, fragmented markets, limited sources of capital, low levels of technology and political risks. It said, “These barriers can increase the cost of doing business and trade in many African countries, especially those that rely heavily on foreign imports of goods and services. For example, a country such as Nigeria, which has a population exceeding 200 million, is one of the biggest economies in the region (United Nations, 2022). Yet it remains highly dependent on the import of goods, such as refined petroleum oils, cars, smartphones, cereals, and pharmaceuticals, to satisfy its consumers (Observatory of Economic Complexity, 2022; Statista, 2023).” The Secretary-General of UNCTAD, Rebeca Grynspan, said the continent’s growing population and large consumer market presents it with an advantage, as firms look for new destinations. Grynspan said, “Africa’s growing population, increasingly large consumer markets, and expanding business opportunities are major sources of growth and prosperity for the world and key factors that position Africa as a strategic region in the drive for geographically diversified supply chains. “Moreover, Africa’s large reserves of critical minerals that are vital for global supply chains of high technology-intensive industries can turn African economies into key suppliers of parts and components in the automotive, electronics, renewable energy, and medical devices sectors.” The agency further revealed that many factors can influence a company’s decision to relocate parts of its supply chain to another country or region, and this includes a conducive environment for increased productivity, high-growth markets, high-profit entrepreneurship, an active and technology-oriented workforce, and a dynamic consumer base. It noted that Nigeria experienced subdued growth in 2022, with inflation, power supply challenges, and lower-than-expected oil production affecting economic performance in the country.",https://punchng.com/nigeria-highly-dependent-on-imported-cars-drugs-un/,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24003500/Rebeca-Grynspan.jpg,2023-08-24 01:35:15,Temitayo Jaiyeola,en,ng,0.14
138402939,INEOS Oxide trusts Globalstar and Ovinto satellite IoT technology to ensure safe delivery of highly explosive chemicals,"DUBLIN, IRELAND, August 24, 2023/EINPresswire.com/ -- Globalstar Europe Satellite Services Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Globalstar, Inc. (NYSE American: GSAT) announced today that leading global petrochemicals provider INEOS Oxide is deploying the Ovinto Sat tracking solution to monitor and safeguard rail and road transport of highly explosive gases across mainland Europe. Following the staged introduction of the system over several years, INEOS Oxide has expanded the deployment and now installs Ovinto Sat sensors across its entire fleet of tank containers and rail cars, a total of approximately 700 devices to date. Globalstar satellite communication at the heart of Ovinto Sat enables INEOS Oxide to know the exact location and status of every tank and rail car, continuously and in real time as they traverse the continent, even when beyond the reach of GSM mobile networks. This regular, reliable dataflow empowers INEOS Oxide and its supply chain partners to make speedy, well-informed business decisions about each delivery and be alerted to any changes in container/car environmental conditions that might affect the shipment. “We are extremely pleased with the performance of Ovinto Sat,” says Business Safety, Health & Environmental (SHE) Manager at INEOS, Patrick De Block. “Ovinto Sat’s innovative and powerful tracking platform helps our business in so many ways, the most important of which is ensuring the safe conveyance of our products.” “There are other solutions out there, but we know that ATEX-certified Ovinto Sat, with its reach and constancy enabled by Globalstar’s satellite technology, is the ideal solution for INEOS Oxide,” De Block added. Two of the main products which INEOS Oxide transports are Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide, primarily used to manufacture products for the following industries and applications: Agrochemicals, Construction, Pharmaceuticals & Personal Care, Solvents and Inks, Surfactants and detergents. Both chemicals are highly explosive, flammable and carcinogenic to humans and animals. Ensuring safety for all stakeholders and public When it comes to transporting such volatile materials safely, says De Block, “we need to know where our assets are, and what their internal temperature is. Ovinto Sat provides this and at the same time is helping us to optimise our systems.” This solution reduces accident risk in transportation by monitoring the condition of the chemicals in each rail car and tank while providing valuable shipment information for the supply chain. Critically, thanks to satellite technology, all stakeholders can be confident that IoT transmissions from the tanks and cars are reliable, ubiquitous and uninterrupted. This ensures the very highest level of safety, benefitting and protecting supply chain partners, infrastructure authorities, and rail and road users. Ovinto Sat provides myriad operational benefits. This IoT-empowered solution gives INEOS Oxide instant updates about whether a rail tank car has been loaded or unloaded or is ready to be redeployed. This helps INEOS Oxide enhance return on investment and optimisation of assets. “We are now able to harvest so much data, we can make informed predictions regarding temperature fluctuation, and any necessary requirement for refrigeration, as our shipments move across countries; this digital information is really valuable for both our operations and continuous assurance of safety,” De Block notes. Frederick Ronse, Ovinto CEO, commented: “With our ongoing engineering enhancements, we will continue to help INEOS Oxide reduce risk, increase the safety of its cars and tanks, and enhance supply chain decision-making. Globalstar technology is our communications core due to its ubiquitous reach, reliability and power efficiency compared to GSM.” “The need for reliable, resilient connectivity is particularly acute when transporting potentially hazardous materials. With no GSM signal over many areas of continental Europe, satellite is the only reliable way of communicating, and we are proud to collaborate with Ovinto to support INEOS,” commented Mark O’Connell, General Manager at Globalstar EMEA & APAC.

139482879,Opinion: Decoding PM Modi's Remarks On China And Supply Chain Worries,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the B20 Summit India 2023 on Sunday and, without naming China, said, ""A profitable market can be sustained when there is a balance in the interests of producers and consumers. This also applies to nations. Treating other countries only as a market will never work. It will harm even the producing countries sooner or later. Making everyone equal partners in progress is the way forward."" At the same meet, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also took a dig at China underlining its lending 'policies', which had reduced the Global South to being a consumer rather than a producer and saddled them with unviable debt that had resulted from China's ""opaque initiatives"". It is significant that both the PM and the Foreign Minister have raised concerns regarding China. Unfolding geopolitical events and their critical impact on trade and business vis-a-vis China in the past years have compelled this stance. It has been observed universally that China, led by President Xi Jinping since 2013, has shown complete disregard for international norms; an example being the protracted stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, Sikkim or Arunachal Pradesh. China has been muscling its way into other neighbours like Vietnam, Japan, and in the South China Sea as well, provoking strong protests and strategic re-alliance among these countries. China has engaged India in border standoffs and a proxy war to further its policy of expansion. As China grew into a mighty economic and military power, what came to the fore was its insolence towards the rules-based international order and a shared commitment to conduct international affairs in accordance with laws, principles and practices embodied in institutions such as the United Nations. China continues to flout regional security arrangements, trade agreements and multilateral financial institutions at every level. India has always believed that the interests of the region are better served through a balance of forces rather than the dominance of any single force - whether it is the Americans or the Chinese. This is one of the pillars of India's Indo-Pacific vision. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has been travelling the world listening to the problems of the Global South. (Global South refers to countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which are developing, less developed, or underdeveloped. These countries have higher levels of poverty, income inequality, and challenging living conditions compared to the wealthier nations of the Global North). Developing nations have always struggled to find a common agenda. Countries come together for a short-term goal or agenda but are rarely willing to coordinate and cooperate over the long term. India in its G20 presidency has gone all out to bring a perceptible change in international systems. The PM and Foreign Minister also raised supply chain worries and called for a more balanced approach to doing business. Supply chain problems emerged during Covid lockdowns due to shifts in demand, labour shortages and structural factors. For India, the pressure was felt when raw material imports from China were stopped. From wooden furniture to nacelle and blade of wind turbines to cells of solar panel modules, India has been dependent on China for the supply of huge volumes of raw materials, which was impacted by the disruptions due to Covid. The delay in procuring these raw materials from alternate sources had a multiplier effect, resulting in project delays and the rise in prices of the finished products in India. The continued ramifications of the Russia-Ukraine war have exacerbated the global divide of access to resources. Countries in the Global South, India included, have been at the receiving end. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has often been seen as a project focused on benefits to China and not the countries that have provided access and infrastructure to build the road. The debt trap that many African nations have fallen into is for the entire world to see. The cost of capital has been so high that the debt trap seems perpetual. Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Kenya, Laos, Mongolia to name a few, are the most indebted nations to China. In these countries, there are no jobs and inflation is skyrocketing, leading to waves of loan defaults and political unrest. The agile response of China in anticipating and acquiring metals that will strengthen the industries of the future has already begun shaking up the powerful West. The Global South can't even comprehend the impending damage. China has been encouraging the use of its currency internationally, including in Brazil. Evolving geopolitical factors are now causing new risks and pockets of stress. Affected sectors include metals and mining, chemicals, automotives, semiconductors and technology. China continues to secure its raw material supplies by buying 23 equity stakes in lithium, nickel and cobalt companies. China has bought half of the world's biggest lithium mines put on the market since 2018. This has given China an edge over the global battery metal supply chain. PM Modi is cautioning against this new model of colonialism when he says those who have the rare critical metals have the global responsibility for inclusive growth of all. The Global North too has not helped matters. According to reports, ""friend-shoring"" has been on the rise in the post Covid era since late 2022, in which bilateral trade benefits the countries that share similar political and economic orientation. At the recent BRICS summit in Johannesburg, there was no consensus between India and China on the expansion of the group. India's approach to promote cooperation among developing countries and engagement with the G7 is opposed by China, which wants countries inclined towards its policies and part of its BRI initiative to join the bloc. This episodic 'tug-of-war' will continue. India, of late, has given up its decade-old stand of not being on the offensive on global forums. It is now showing signs of resistance and building allies across the globe to suit its internal needs. But it needs more allies to come out in the open and challenge China's hegemony in the economic sphere.

139714455,Wilko stores lie empty as fight to save the embattled High Street retailer enters 11th hour - and...,"Shelves in under-threat high street giant Wilko were laid bare today - as devoted shoppers snapped up its low-price brands. The stores - which has been plunged into administration - has been decimated by a fall in profits, despite good usage of the outlets. And their popularity was plain to see in the Wimbledon branch, where shoppers had stripped the shelves of goods. The combination of already-low prices combined with a mass discount sale meant stock looked to be running low at least there. Wilko's profits plummeted by £38.7 million last year as sales fell by 3.3 per cent to £1.2 billion, and rising inflation hitting families in the pocket. The budget-chain had become a staple for Britain's shoppers who are after stationery, gardening supplies, homeware, cleaning products, or just a pot of pick-and-mix. It comes as Wilko has suspended redundancies while administrators consider rescue offers, according to the GMB union. The union said on Tuesday it discussed a number of potential bids to save the stricken high street chain with the insolvency experts. Shelves are looking bare at a Wilko store in Wimbledon after it launched a discount sale after going into administration Shops are expected to close within weeks, with thousands of job losses unless a rescue deal can be secured Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said: ""All redundancies at Wilko have been suspended while the administrator considers further bids. ""Whilst this is a positive development, Wilko is not out of the woods by any means and this is a time of incredible stress and worry for the 12,500 workers who face losing their jobs."" It comes after reports of fresh last-minute bids to potentially buy the retailer. At the weekend Wilko's former boss of 15 years Gordon Brown criticised the founder's granddaughter Lisa Wilkinson for ditching the tried-and-tested strategy of discount prices, and for veering away from 'their successful model of low price, low cost'. Wilko's managing director from 1992 to 2007 told The Mail on Sunday: 'Wilko was a convenience store where you went to buy bits and pieces for your house for a low price.' A number of staple items were missing from the shelves after the administration went public There were other empty shelves in other Wilko stores as shown on social media this month He added: 'They paid consultants who helped them bring about a new format for stores. 'But they were less aggressive on pricing and their approach on the shop floor.' A private equity firm has offered a £90million rescue deal in a fresh bid to save Wilko and its 12,000 jobs - just days after after HMV's owner announced his interest in the struggling retail chain. The equity firm, M2 Capital, confirmed it has put in the 11th-hour bid to save the popular budget retailer, which is on the brink of collapse after falling into administration earlier this month. The firm's managing director Robert Mantse told the BBC if his offer was accepted by administrators for Wilko, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), M2 will endeavour to 'guarantee all employees' jobs for two years'. Last week HMV tycoon Doug Putman emerged as Wilko's most likely saviour with him tabling a last-ditch multi-million-pound rescue offer. A private equity firm has offered an £90million rescue deal in a fresh bid to save Wilko and its 12,000 jobs The equity firm, M2 Capital, confirmed it has put in the 11th-hour bid to save Wilko. Pictured is the firm's managing director Robert Mantse Retail mogul Doug Putman, 39, whose firm, Sunrise Records, bought HMV in 2019, is understood to currently be in talks with Wilko bosses The 39-year-old owns the British CD seller and Canada's largest toy business Toys R Us, and in talks with administrators PwC to buy part of the business. He has proposed to keep around 200 of its 400 shops and between 3,000 and 4,000 of its 12,000 staff. The deal would also mean the survival of the Wilko brand. Administrators were said to be working through the weekend to analyse a final bid from Mr Putman, in order to secure the best outcome for creditors and staff. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said today: 'The Canadian tycoon we have to thank for HMV is in talks to rescue around half of stricken Wilko shops, which would save up to around 4,000 jobs. 'While a deal is far from guaranteed, and is even unlikely by some estimations, it does offer a glimmer of hope to high street users and Wilko staff facing huge uncertainty. 'The Wilko model of ""pile it high and sell it cheap"" saw its wheels come off as volumes weren't what they needed to be following the enormous pressure heaped on the chain following the pandemic, and its online proposition was slow to shine compared to others.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12456831/Wilko-stores-lie-fight-save-embattled-High-Street-retailer-enters-11th-hour-job-cuts-suspended-rescue-bids-considered.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/29/13/74830861-0-image-a-21_1693312266846.jpg,2023-08-29 15:37:55,Dan Sales,en,gb,0.054
140355513,Taiwanese firms in China’s richest county are all the buzz – will they stay or will they go?,"About an hour drive west of Shanghai, China’s most affluent county – Kunshan – has accommodated a Foxconn complex in its northern region for 30 years. And in that time, the Taiwanese electronic contract manufacturer has recruited hundreds of thousands of young workers from nearby rural areas to assemble a wide range of products, from iPhone cables to MacBook cases for Apple. Since the beginning of the year, however, rumours about the plant being moved from the county to Vietnam have run rampant. Still, the talk has not deterred new workers from entering the assembly line, nor has it stopped recruiters from relentlessly soliciting labourers for 26 yuan (US$3.57) per hour on a sweltering midsummer night in August. “I feel that [the plant] cannot be pulled out in a year or two,” a worker on the iPhone-power-plug assembly line told the Post at the factory gate. “It would take at least a few years.” But in the county of 2 million people in southern Jiangsu province, such gossip about Taiwanese manufacturers pulling away – and not just Foxconn – has inevitably proved worrisome to many locals. China’s richest county for the past 17 years, Kunshan boomed as Taiwan’s money flowed in. In total, 30 per cent of the county’s gross domestic product (GDP), 50 per cent of industrial output, 60 per cent of foreign investment, and 70 per cent of its imports and exports are directly tied to Taiwan-funded enterprises. As of 2020, there were more than 5,300 Taiwanese companies and around 100,000 Taiwanese people in Kunshan, according to the People’s Daily party mouthpiece. With mainland China not doing well, Taiwan ups South Asia, Asean investments So, if they were to leave, what sort of future would the county have? The speculation has also cast a pall over cross-strait affairs. In the past three decades, the strengthening of economic ties has long been the cornerstone of peaceful relations between the mainland and the self-ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province that must eventually be reunited with the mainland – by force, if necessary. This has left some to wonder whether an era is coming to an end. No official data is available on how many Taiwanese companies have exited the county this year, but multiple businessmen confirmed that people are leaving, and others are at least exploring business opportunities outside not only the city but also the country. It is getting increasingly difficult to convene people for regular gatherings in the Taiwanese business community in many towns of Kunshan, factory owners told the Post. “When the Covid-19 lockdowns ended last year, it was not difficult at all to gather people for a dinner of 30 tables. But now, no matter how hard we try, it is – at most – 20 tables,” said Taiwanese construction-material supplier Adam Chang, who is also the head of a local business association. In public, officials from both Beijing and Kunshan have vehemently denied that there has been an outflow of Taiwanese firms. In May, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, refuted Taiwanese media reports saying that one-third of Taiwanese companies in the city of Suzhou – which administers Kunshan – had left, and that most of the remaining two-thirds had transferred some production capacity out. Some of the factories remain here, but the bosses have left Chen, former Kunshan manufacturer Ma called the reports false, countering that the city had 98 newly established Taiwan firms with used capital of US$612 million in the first quarter – respective increases of 6.5 per cent and 96 per cent compared with a year prior. But it’s the losses – whatever they may be – that locals are more concerned with. A floor-coating equipment manufacturer surnamed Chen was among those who left Kunshan earlier this year. The 28-year-old native of Taichung, Taiwan, resettled his facility in the mainland city of Huzhou, Zhejiang province, because the township where he had been operating in Kunshan – near the touristy site of Zhouzhuang, which is famous for its canals – decided to pivot toward its growing tourism industry while simultaneously tightening up controls on manufacturers. “Some of the factories remain here, but the bosses have left,” Chen said, adding that young Taiwanese have still been coming to work on the mainland since Beijing eased border restrictions in January, but it does not appear to be offsetting the number of those leaving. This is the opposite of the trend seen three decades ago, when the mainland saw flocks of Taiwanese firms – many of them small in size – coming in, as Beijing’s opening-up policy, lower costs and a similar cultural background made the mainland very appealing. Beijing hints at changing trade pact with Taiwan amid probe into tariffs But nowadays, geopolitical concerns are having a bigger influence on Taiwanese firms’ decisions of whether to relocate operations away from the mainland. Despite its rising labour and land costs, China is generally still considered the “world’s factory”, even as other countries have stepped up to challenge that standing. China’s supply chain and vast network of infrastructure give it manufacturing advantages over regional alternatives, but Taiwanese manufacturers have found themselves increasingly pressured by downstream foreign clients to move production elsewhere – such as Vietnam and Thailand – since 2018. That was when former US president Donald Trump started to push US companies to decouple from China and initiated a trade war with Beijing by imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports. During the past three years of the pandemic, however, the soaring global demand for electronic products offered a bit of a respite to manufacturers, in terms of outward industrial capacity transfers. But as the pandemic ended, the trend has accelerated on a much wider scale, as “de-risking” from China once again became the priority of President Joe Biden’s administration, which has sought to secure supply chains of critical electronics on national security grounds and to diversify China-centric supply chains to other countries under the “China plus one” strategy. The exodus of Taiwanese firms stands out – in comparison with other foreign companies or private enterprises in China – because they are concentrated so heavily on the export-focused electronics sector, said Peter Tu, a Kunshan-based machinery manufacturer. [Exporters] to the United States must go to Vietnam ... If they don’t go, they won’t receive any more orders Peter Tu, Kunshan manufacturer “Those with final products exported to the United States must go to Vietnam,” the Tainan native said. “That’s the request from their clients. If they don’t go, they won’t receive any more orders. “So, despite all the inconveniences of a relocation, they still have to go, just to survive.” The process seems to have already taken a toll on China’s exports. According to official customs data, exports from foreign manufacturers declined by 15.5 per cent, year on year, in the first seven months of 2023, compared with a 9 per cent general decline among all exporters. The fall was mostly driven by dwindling shipments from the so-called processing trade, which involves importing all or some raw materials and re‑exporting the finished products after processing or assembly by enterprises within the country – with electronic products such as smartphones being the major products exported under the category. In Kunshan, the settlement of large Taiwanese electronic manufacturers such as Foxconn – which also operates a second plant in southern Kunshan – has brought about and fed thousands of small electronic and mechanical auxiliary plants in the island’s entire supply chain for decades. But now, if the big guys are mulling an exit, the smaller ones have no choice but to follow, multiple businessmen told the Post. Hello, Mumbai? Taiwan’s tech firms consider ‘plan B’ amid US-China tensions In addition to American importers, more and more clients from other countries say they are requiring Taiwanese exporters to build an alternative supply chain away from mainland China, over fears of rising uncertainties amid US-China tensions, potential disruptions from any future lockdowns, and because of escalating tensions across the strait. Since the beginning of the year, grease-gun manufacturer Ray Kuo has been frequently asked by other Taiwanese factory owners in Kunshan the same question: “Should I go to Southeast Asia?” But relocating to Southeast Asia is not without its challenges, as Kuo can attest. Poor infrastructure, unstable power supplies, different cultures and languages, and rising operational costs could serve to offset the benefits of cheaper labour and land. In 2018, at the height of the US-China trade war, Kuo hastily invested 4 million yuan in a new plant in Thailand, as exports to the US accounted for around one-third of his company’s total revenue. But he failed to account for soaring operating costs in Thailand, and he lost 5 million yuan over four years before he was forced to reinvest in his original Kunshan facility late last year. The major problem was Thailand’s incomplete supply chain, he said. His plant there still needed to import parts and raw materials from mainland China, resulting in additional shipping costs, tariffs and taxes that drove up expenses by more than 20 per cent. If you don’t go, you are waiting for death. But if you go, you are courting death Ray Kuo, manufacturer “But the clients wouldn’t accept if you raised prices by 20 per cent,” Kuo said. “So, we have to continue manufacturing in China, and what we can do is improve our service and products. Though some clients are complaining, they are still placing orders from us. If they shift to other suppliers, we cannot stop them either. What we can do is explore new export markets while expanding our share in the domestic market.” While Kuo still has the leeway to pivot to other business opportunities, the auxiliary plants whose major customers have already moved their production bases to Southeast Asia are facing the reality that staying on the mainland means lost orders, while moving would also come at considerable expense, he said. And keeping multiple bases is not always a viable option for smaller firms, as it means many costs are doubled, with no guarantee that revenue will double, he added. “Nobody is willing to leave; they are all forced by their clients,” said Kuo, who moved from Taichung to Kunshan 20 years ago. “It’s like, if you don’t go, you are waiting for death. But if you go, you are courting death. “All of this is because of the conflicts between [China and the US]. We Taiwanese businessmen are completely victims.” Younger Chinese are taking over family factories. Can they save the industry? Five of the Kunshan-based Taiwanese factory owners who spoke with the Post said they expected their revenue to go down at least 40 per cent this year, and one expected that his peers in the region were likely facing similar declines. In addition to capital leaving the mainland, the inflow of new money is also slowing down. According to data released by the Investment Commission of Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, new investments in China by Taiwanese companies declined by 4.78 per cent in the first seven months of the year to US$2.01 billion. Currently, a consensus among the community in Kunshan is that most young Taiwanese there are second-generation factory owners – or “changerdai” – who have been living on the mainland since childhood, while those who grew up back in Taiwan are getting more and more detached from the mainland, and are thus less willing to move there compared with the older generation. Even among changerdai, those who are willing to take over their fathers’ plants on the mainland are not in the majority, as many prefer to pursue a different career path. Meanwhile, in the face of shrinking profits against the background of a global slowdown, a staggering post-pandemic economic recovery in China, as well as rising geopolitical tensions, a wave of retirement has been brought forward. Many of the older generation who are entering their sixties and have devoted half of their lives to the mainland plants are simply closing down or selling off their assets and going back to Taiwan. “This early wave of retirement is mostly because of the US-China tensions,” said Kuo, the grease gun manufacturer. “Because for many people in their fifties or sixties, while they are still able to maintain the normal operations of an existing plant, it is too risky for them to start over in Southeast Asia if their children don’t want to help out.” The three years of stringent coronavirus controls, which restricted normal business travel, also accelerated the trend, he added. Japan, Philippines, South Korea most open to ‘huge disruption’ of any Taiwan war As for the heightened military tensions in the Taiwan Strait that followed high-level visits by US officials to Taiwan since last August, some businessmen said it doesn’t really factor into their business decisions. “There is no actual impact on our behaviour, but it still has some psychological implications,” said the Huzhou-based Chen. Cross-strait ties are likely to be further complicated by Taiwan’s presidential election early next year, with many watching to see how independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party candidate William Lai Ching-te fares at the polls. “How is it possible for Taiwanese businessmen to increase their investments if the sense of crisis in the Taiwan Strait is so imminent,” asked Kuo. “We won’t feel secure even if we pull our assets back to Taiwan, if there’s a war in the strait. We’d basically have nowhere to go but to jump into the sea.” “As long as we can maintain peace across the strait, everyone will have the confidence to invest more, but in the current unstable circumstances, everyone is worried.”",https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3232976/taiwanese-firms-chinas-richest-county-are-all-buzz-will-they-stay-or-will-they-go,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/31/6524d805-b3ef-4d36-876f-8bcd8b460c4d_ccc6d590.jpg,2023-09-01 00:00:17,Ji Siqi,en,hk,-0.055

Get a PDF brochure for Industrial Insights and Business Intelligence @ https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/187 Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) refer to solar power generating components that are used in constructing facades, roofs, and skylights in buildings. Generally, these components include the integration of photovoltaic modules, a backup power supply system, a charge controller, a power storage system, and other supporting hardware. BIPV materials offer several benefits over their traditional counterparts as they provide onsite power generation, zero emissions, high energy conservation, superior architectural integration, and optimal shading. In addition, BIPVs also help reduce labor and installation costs by replacing high-end roof membranes, skylight glazing, and façade cladding. The global demand for building integrated photovoltaics market is primarily driven by an increase in efforts by national governments for the installation of solar energy panels. A rise in awareness regarding green infrastructure, including buildings with energy efficiency, is expected to boost demand for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). BIPV provides a sustainable and effective solution for enhancing the energy efficiency of a structure, retrofitting the exterior of a structure, and providing significant savings in conventional power consumption. In addition, a rise in the implementation of supportive government regulations including financial benefits and incentives to promote green infrastructure, and a rise in investments in the solar industry across the globe are expected to increase solar energy integration in residential and commercial sectors during the forecast period. However, high initial costs of investments are expected to hamper the building integrated photovoltaics market growth during the forecast period. Furthermore, heat generation from BIPV modules is expected to provide growth opportunities for the global market during the forecast period. By technology, the global building integrated photovoltaics market size is studied across crystalline silicon, thin film, and others. The crystalline silicon segment accounted for the largest market share in 2020, owing to its superior resistance to adverse weather conditions and high strength.

COVID-19 analysis: The building integrated photovoltaics market is expected to decline in 2020, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. Governments of several major economies have enforced lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19. With the lockdown in place, manufacturing activities have been affected significantly. For instance, in January 2020, the government of China announced a lockdown of more than 30 days to tackle COVID-19. As the majority of PV modules are manufactured in China, production and supply chain has taken a significant hit. For instance, India imports ~80% of its solar value chain supplies from China. Lockdown had drastically affected the manufacturing capacity of China as all major ship container companies had also stopped functioning out of Chinese ports and transporting goods from China to other countries. This resulted in supply chain disruptions in March and April 2020. In addition, lockdowns implemented in other countries caused supply chain disruptions and labor shortages in the PV industry. Companies were not able to source the required labor for their operations due to travel restrictions. Though the market is expected to be impacted in 2020, recovery is expected to commence in 2021, with full recovery by 2022.

142181751,China's NEV industry speeds ahead in global electrification race,"BEIJING, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- China's new energy vehicle (NEV) sector has turbocharged growth in recent years, getting a head start in the global race to electrify cars and fostering competitive edges in its domestic auto brands. In its latest move to boost NEV development, China said it aims to bring this year's NEV sales to 9 million units, an increase of 30 percent year on year, according a work plan unveiled last week. In the first seven months of this year, China saw its NEV sales surge 41.7 percent from a year ago to 4.53 million units, official data shows. Globally, the country has ranked first in terms of production and sales for eight straight years since 2015. Zhu Yifang, a researcher with the China Automotive Technology and Research Center Co., Ltd., said that policy support has been an ""accelerator"" for the development of China's NEV industry over the years. China rolled out its first NEV development plan in 2008. The country's policymakers, at both central and local levels, have since provided consistent and solid support for the development of the sector. East China's Anhui Province is a typical example. It was among the first provinces to develop NEVs in China, and has long leveraged policy stimulus to spur the growth of the industry. Anhui is now home to carmakers such as Chery and Nio. On the consumption front, preferential policies have encouraged people to choose new energy cars over fossil-fueled ones, facilitating the expansion of the NEV market and powering firms along the industrial chain to step up innovation. The fast-growing market has prompted battery producers to dig deeper into materials and structures, pushing China's power battery sector to the forefront globally, said Wu Kai, chief scientist with Chinese battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. With policy support and market-driven innovation, China has put in place a relatively complete NEV industrial chain, covering batteries, motors, electronic controls, and vehicle manufacturing and sales. In the Yangtze River Delta, where industrial clusters are well-developed, a new energy car manufacturer can basically find all the components it needs within a four-hour drive. Shanghai supplies chips and software, while the cities of Changzhou and Ningbo, both of which are about 200 kilometers away from Shanghai, provide power batteries and die-casting machines, respectively. In the past, competition in the sector was mainly about special technologies, but nowadays what matters more is the industrial chain, said Xu Jun, vice president of Chinese car manufacturer Leapmotor. Official data shows that China's NEV exports totaled 636,000 units in the first seven months of this year, an increase of more than 1.5 fold from the previous year, a sign of the increasing global recognition of made-in-China NEVs. As China's growing NEV manufacturing has grown stronger, the competition landscape of the global auto industry has also been reshaped, prompting overseas auto behemoths to expand their market presence and roll out more electric fleets. Tesla was quick in establishing itself within China's NEV market. After building a Gigafactory in Shanghai -- its first outside the United States -- the automaker announced in April that it would build a new mega factory in the metropolis. Carmakers from other auto manufacturing powerhouses have also jumped on the bandwagon. Japan's Toyota has teamed up with Chinese automaker Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd. to develop new energy models, and German car manufacturer Volkswagen Group has set up its global new energy car R&D center in Anhui Province. Doubling down on NEVs, Volkswagen reached an agreement in July to buy a 4.99-percent stake in the Chinese electric vehicle startup Xpeng and co-develop two NEV models for the Chinese market. Back in the era of petrol vehicles, cooperation between multinationals and China's local automakers was usually made because China traded its vast market for technologies. In the Volkswagen-Xpeng deal, however, the German carmaker's primary purpose is to access Xpeng's technologies, according to industry insiders. This turnaround in the form of cooperation is evidence that China has become a stronger force in the transformation of the global auto industry, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association. According to Zhu Yifang, if China's new energy carmakers want to benefit from the current momentum, they should consolidate their advantages and catch up with their overseas peers in such areas as brand value, technology R&D and global layout. Fu Bingfeng, executive vice president of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, called for sustained efforts to improve the development of chips, basic software, key materials and other weak links in the industrial chain. Amid the global wave of electrification and intelligent transformation, China's carmakers must step up technological innovation and make car manufacturing more digitalized and intelligent, Zhu said.",https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/273958420/china-nev-industry-speeds-ahead-in-global-electrification-race,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/xih1694088309.jpg,2023-09-07 14:05:12,,en,au,0.218
142365121,Meet the wind energy billionaire who owns the fastest electric car racing team on the planet,"Zhang is trying to spread the idea of an integrated, self-sufficient energy network he calls “Green Utopia,” and a leading Chinese environmentalist calls his vision “thrilling.” He is like a Chinese Elon Musk, but so far without the bombast and need for constant attention. So who is he? Zhang, 47, grew up east of Shanghai in Jiangyin, near Wuxi, on the banks of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province. His father, Zhāng Shìquán 张士泉 earned a good living by starting a foundry equipment plant in 2001. He was so successful that he eventually became known as the “foundry equipment king” (铸造设备大王 zhùzào shèbèi dàwáng). The business was part of China’s industrial boom when factories spewed filth into the air and water. Zhang Lei grew up in this environment, which perhaps partly inspired his vision — as described on the website of his Formula E team — of not seeking just to make revenue and profit but of “combining art and science” to achieve “beautiful energy.” Envision Energy was founded in 2007 to make this happen, and he has grand ambitions. In 2019, Zhang advised the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s annual parliamentary session, on the text of an Energy Law that has yet to be enacted. In the run-up to that year’s NPC session, Zhang stated in interviews that “an excellent company needs to be ahead of the government. The company must foresee the future development trend before the government, and even inspire the government.” In answer to a question on why Envision is not a listed company, Zhang answered that remaining privately held was the “correct development path” (正确的发展方向 zhèngquède fāzhǎn fāngxiàng) for Envision, which he described as Microsoft, Tesla, and Google rolled into one. In late 2022, a year in which China’s carbon emissions from energy production were the highest in the world at 12.1 gigatonnes (Gt), while those in the U.S. were 4.7 Gt, International Energy Agency (IEA) data showed, Zhang told TIME magazine he was inspired by the idea of “harmonizing energy and the environment.” But Zhang said he wanted to help reduce emissions everywhere, not just in China. Green report card In 2021, Envision said it planned to achieve carbon neutrality across its operations by the end of 2022, and carbon neutrality in its entire value chain six years later. “Envision’s commitment to reach carbon neutrality across the entire value chain in 2028 is one of the earliest and most thrilling in the corporate sector,” environmental journalist and activist Mǎ Jūn 马军 told The China Project. Director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, Ma developed the Corporate Climate Action Transparency Index (CATI) to assess if companies are cleaning up or greenwashing their pollution output. Envision’s preliminary 2023 CATI score is 54.1 out of 100, which makes it one of the frontrunners on climate action in China. However, Ma expressed concern about the carbon inventory and disclosure data Envision claimed to have collected from more than 150 of its key suppliers. Although Envision has committed to pushing its suppliers to use only renewable energy by 2025, Ma said that so far, “we haven’t seen any disclosed progress, and its pathway to achieving net zero across their value chain is also unclear.” Envision’s lack of transparency presents the sector and consumers with a conundrum. On the one hand, Zhang Lei’s company is a renewable energy juggernaut and one of China’s leading wind energy manufacturers, and on the other it is difficult to wade through the company’s pronouncements about an energy revolution. The China Project asked Envision for an interview with Zhang but received no response. Son of privilege Zhang Lei is often depicted in the Chinese press as a quintessential child of second-generation wealth, a fùèrdài (富二代) who experienced his family’s transition from poverty to opulence as he grew up. Like many fuerdai, Zhang got an expensive education. In 1999, he graduated from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology with a degree in international business management. He then set off for the London School of Economics (LSE), where the Mathematics Department website describes his postgraduate degree in Operations Research and Analytics as teaching “the skills needed to apply mathematical methods to real-world analytics problems faced by companies.” After LSE, Zhang could have returned to the now extensive family foundry business in Jiangsu Province, eventually taking over the reins of the range of companies, in one of which he became a shareholder in 2005. Instead, Zhang stayed on in London and took jobs in The City, first as a trading strategist at the French oil giant Total, and then as a derivatives trader at Barclays Bank. Then, in 2007, when Zhang was 31, he had a big idea, and he had the global business connections to help him launch it back home in China. It started with wind Soon after he arrived back in Jiangyin, Zhang founded Envision Energy, a wind turbine manufacturer, with about a dozen colleagues including Felix Zhang (张旭宇 Zhāng Xùyǔ, no relation) a man with degrees from Harvard and Stanford who had worked in London in 2004-2005 — the same time as Zhang Lei — as an equity analyst for Morgan Stanley. At the outset, Envision was supported by the local governments of Wuxi and Jiangyin, whose large investments and subsidized loans allowed the company to build a plant and hire workers. While government regulations were pushing international wind energy manufacturers out of China, Zhang Lei hired away their technical experts, recruiting from Danish wind giant Vestas and the German-Spanish film Siemens Gamesa. In 2008, Envision produced its first wind turbine, followed a year later by its first big order: thirty-three 1.5 MW wind turbines for Longyuan Power, then Asia’s largest wind power generator. By 2014, Envision was among China’s top three turbine manufacturers. Philip Totaro, founder and CEO of renewables market intelligence consultancy IntelStor, advises Envision on technology development and market entry strategies. “Their ambition was always to provide solutions and get involved in turnkey projects as opposed to simply being a supply chain company,” Totaro told The China Project. “Zhang Lei and Felix Zhang have been very carefully cultivating a brand as well as orchestrating their technology development to help them achieve the company’s ambitions.” In 2016, Zhang Lei told People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, that he wished to attain a “Green Utopia” (绿托邦 lütuōbāng) through strategic investments, careful management of all energy sources, and integration of supply upstream and demand downstream. He said he saw an “energy symphony” in which billions of solar panels, EVs, batteries, and household appliances are conducted seamlessly by an Internet of Things network in which everyone can be both a producer and consumer of energy. Media reports echoed all of this hype, but the company had some bad press in February 2019, when a court in Guangdong Province in south China found that an Envision engineer posing as a supplier had infiltrated a wind turbine installation project belonging to competitor Mingyang. Armed with a camera and a digital rangefinder used to measure distances, the Envision spy was discovered, apprehended, and later sentenced by the court to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of 1 million yuan ($137,974) for industrial espionage. Envision claimed that the man was a former employee and had taken photos as a hobby. The court agreed and Envision went unsanctioned. By 2022, Envision Energy had the world’s fourth-largest newly installed wind turbine capacity that year — 8.3 GW — behind Goldwind, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa; and today, the company claims to be China’s largest producer of “smart” offshore wind turbines. Envision has also developed a particular competency for low-speed onshore turbines and is engaged with the European Union in developing a new type of wind turbine using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) technology as an alternative to direct-drive turbines. In February 2023, Envision brought online an onshore turbine of 10 MW, calling it the world’s largest onshore turbine. Chinese or Japanese? In 2018, Envision Energy added EV battery manufacturing to its portfolio by acquiring 80% of Automotive Energy Supply Corp. (AESC), a company owned by Japanese carmaker Nissan, which retained a stake of 20%. With this deal, Envision acquired AESC’s plants in Japan, the U.S. and the U.K., and a host of international clients including Honda and Mazda, and BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Renault. In Europe, AESC’s Chinese ownership is in plain view. On June 28, 2021, French President Emmanuel Macron joined Zhang at the unveiling of a $2.4 billion “Chinese battery factory” in Douai, northern France, to supply Renault’s EVs. In July 2022, Zhang joined online the signing ceremony for an agreement with the Spanish government to build an AESC EV battery factory in Extremadura, in the west of the country, as well as hydrogen generation and wind turbine assembly plants. But as Envision started expanding its U.S. manufacturing facilities beyond AESC’s first EV battery plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, the company chose to hide its Chinese ownership. On August 30, 2022, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear helped Envision AESC break ground on a $2 billion plant in Bowling Green, designed for 2,000 locals to start producing EV batteries in a plant the size of 52 football fields, or 3 million square feet, set to be fully operational by 2027. The words “China” and “Chinese” were absent from reports on the event. On June 7, 2023, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster helped break ground on an $810 million investment from what he called a “world-leading Japanese electric vehicle battery technology company,” whose new plant would bring 1,170 new jobs to a 1.5 million square foot plant in Florence County set to open in 2026. In 2022, South Carolina exported more passenger vehicles than any other U.S. state for the ninth year in a row. When it’s fully operational, the AESC plant in Florence will produce battery cells for EVs produced at a BMW facility that produces 1,500 vehicles a day, located 187 miles to the northwest in Spartanburg. Through Envision, AESC is now more Chinese than Japanese and is a core component of Zhang Lei’s global ambitions. However, given American opposition to Chinese EV battery business in various U.S. states, Zhang and the officials of Kentucky and South Carolina chose to downplay the company’s ownership. In doing so they hoped to avoid what happened when Ford announced a partnership with Chinese EV battery maker CATL in December 2022: Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin called the project a “Trojan horse” and the plant was moved to Michigan. In the wake of rising U.S.-China tensions following the February 1, 2023 destruction of a Chinese spy balloon floating over the U.S., the backlash against Chinese ownership extended to the U.K. In July 2023, when Indian conglomerate Tata announced plans to spend about $5 billion on a new EV battery plant in Somerset in the southwest of the U.K., it refused to confirm whether AESC was involved so as to avoid losing support from Conservative parliamentarians opposed to any of the $637 million in state aid offered Tata going to a Chinese company instead. In August 2023, The Financial Times reported that AESC is “deeply involved” in Tata’s project in Somerset. AESC, consistently identified in media reports in the U.S. and U.K. as “Japanese,” already has a battery plant in Sunderland in the U.K.’s northeast, and is building a second plant there. Branching out: software and energy storage With Envision’s wind business well established, in 2017, Zhang Lei founded Envision Digital in Singapore to produce Artificial Intelligence software to integrate photovoltaic power plants, energy storage systems, and wind farms and manage decarbonization in all energy systems. While Envision Energy has an estimated value of $12 billion, and AESC $7.2 billion, according to the 2023 Hurun Global Unicorn List, Envision Digital clocks in at $3.6 billion. Envision Digital claims its software is in widespread use among operators of solar and wind farms, but seldom identifies specific customers or explains how its operating system works. Those customers it does name include Microsoft and the Port of Singapore Authority. Hurun lists Zhang Lei’s personal fortune at $5.2 billion. In 2018, Envision expanded into energy storage — industrial-size batteries that can power houses, apartments, and factories. By 2022, Envision was China’s eighth-largest energy storage provider, a China Energy Storage Alliance report showed. In May 2023, Envision won a public tender to develop two liquid-cooled energy storage plants for the Harmony Energy Income Trust in the U.K., operator of about half of Britain’s battery energy storage, thereby breaking the HEIT’s dependence on Tesla, its sole partner since 2016. Electric race cars and EV batteries Also in 2018, Envision invested (along with Richard Branson’s Virgin Group) in a team of Formula E race cars — a global circuit of electric vehicles only slightly slower than their gasoline-powered counterparts in Formula 1. In 2020, the U.K.’s Carbon Trust certified the team carbon neutral and in November 2021, Envision bought out Branson, ditched the Virgin name, rebranded the team Envision Racing, and painted the speedy EVs green to match their claim to being “the greenest team in Formula E.” Formula E cars produce no carbon emissions and speed around the track without the signature high-pitched engine wail of Formula 1 cars. Envision Racing showcases the company’s EV battery technology and, in the 2022/2023 season of 16 rounds, the team finished at the top of the standings, beating out 9 other teams. “Envision’s EV battery and grid energy storage technology has become more desirable due to the investment made in the quality of those solutions, particularly driven by their involvement in Formula E and development of distinct intellectual property around their grid energy storage technology,” Envision advisor Totaro of consultancy IntelStor said. Still, Envision’s EV battery maker AESC is experiencing growing pains at its U.S. facilities. Anonymous employee reviews posted on the site Glassdoor dating back to 2020 were mixed — complimentary about the pay but critical of the long hours and poor benefits, and of management’s poor communication skills. In 2020, when AESC was laying off staff due to COVID, a reviewer claiming to be a supervisor with five years’ experience at the Smyrna, Tennessee plant, wrote that morale had plummeted since Envision bought AESC.

143332749,"Tesco’s Irish arm made €120m profit last year, the first accounts ever published show","Sales edged 4.8pc higher to just under €3bn in the 12 months to the end of February this year, from €2.84bn the year before. However, operating profit generated in the most recent period was almost 15pc lower than the previous financial year. That profit decline was driven by inflation increases, higher energy costs and an increased property impairment charge of €21.3m. That saw its profit margin fall to 4pc from 4.9pc the previous year. The company also paid a near €120m dividend payment to its immediate parent – double the amount it paid the year before. The accounts also show that Tesco paid €80.2m in cash for the family-owned Joyce’s Supermarkets chain in Galway last year. That included the purchase of nine stores by Tesco. The Galway chain was owned by Pat Joyce and his family. Like-for-like sales for Tesco in Ireland in the year to the end of last February rose 3.3pc, but had jumped 6.6p in the second half of the financial year as inflation soared. That saw the price of a range of products from chicken to bread jump in all retailers’ stores. The chain, the biggest grocery retailer in Ireland alongside Dunnes Stores, expects sales in Ireland to grow 4.7pc this financial year. The chain, which employs about 13,000 people in Ireland, also said it enjoyed a “particularly strong” Christmas trading period, even when comparing with higher levels of at-home festive consumption the previous year due to continuing Covid-related restrictions. Tesco said customers using its Clubcard accounted for 77pc of all sales in the last financial year, which is “driving increased customer loyalty”. “Our general merchandising and clothing business performed particularly well as we lapped non-food restrictions last year with like-for-like growth of 5.4pc,” the directors note in the newly-filed accounts. At the end of last February, Tesco operated 166 outlets in Ireland and added 13 during the financial year. Those new outlets included four new Express stores and the nine new outlets in Galway following the acquisition of Joyce’s Supermarkets. Tesco also contributed €1.7m to charities and community projects during the year, the accounts show. The chief executive of Tesco Ireland, Natasha Adams, said the decision to publish accounts for the Irish business was made back in January. “We made the decision to begin publishing our statutory accounts for Tesco Ireland to address transparency in our business, and demonstrate the significant contribution that Tesco makes to the Irish economy,” she said. Ms Adams said the commitment includes supporting the Irish agri-food sector, the direct and indirect support of employment, and supporting the Irish economy. “For 25 years we have been embedded in the Irish retail landscape, and as a local arm of a global business we benefit from economies of scale and investment from Tesco Group, which mean the operating costs of our business are lower than a typical business of our scale and size,” said Ms Adams. “In a challenging year for many customers, this has allowed us to invest in keeping the cost of the weekly shop as affordable as possible, working closely alongside our supplier partners,” she added. Ms Adams pointed out that as a group, Tesco is the largest purchaser of Irish food and drink in the world, buying €1.6bn a year worth of those goods.",https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/tescos-irish-arm-made-120m-profit-last-year-the-first-accounts-ever-published-show/a297686197.html,https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/YL7VSYMrP3QV2bIix-KkjuRSoQE=/0x0:960x640/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/0dfb0b36-898e-4929-8e53-6703391e477c/30ebae7e-495a-4ede-9251-44eb121aacd8/0dfb0b36-898e-4929-8e53-6703391e477c.jpg,2023-09-12 14:15:40,John Mulligan,en,ie,-0.084
143888369,Schaeffler and H2 Green Steel intensify cooperation,"Schaeffler and H2 Green Steel intensify cooperation Increase in equity stake adds third pillar to cooperative venture, alongside strategic technology partnership and off-take agreementSchaeffler increases equity interest in H2 Green Steel to 100 million eurosUse of steel produced by H2 Green Steel reduces CO2 emissions by up to 95 percent compared with conventional steelGreen steel: key lever for supply chain decarbonization Schaeffler, the motion technology company, and Swedish startup H2 Green Steel have decided to intensify their already close partnership. The two companies made the decision in the course of a recent equity funding round, in which Schaeffler agreed to invest a further 65 million euros, a significant increase that takes its total stake to 100 million euros. That’s the most equity Schaeffler has ever put into a minority stake in another company. As a strategic technology partner of H2 Green Steel, Schaeffler will channel its know-how into the development of new steel products, such as green e-steel for electromobility. In addition, the two companies will jointly develop new applications for the use of sustainable rolling bearing solutions in production. The aim is to maximize the efficiency of production through the use of first-rate components and integrated condition monitoring solutions. The two companies will also benefit from each other’s expertise in the areas of digitalization and circular economy. “Achieving sustainability across the entire value chain requires cooperation between strong partners who are willing to move forward together with commitment and determination,” Klaus Rosenfeld, Chief Executive Officer of Schaeffler AG, said. “Schaeffler and H2 Green Steel are both pioneers with true innovative power, and we are now synergizing these strengths even further. The increased capital stake and the strategic technology partnership follow the off- take agreement of 2021 as the next logical step as our two organizations seek to work together even more closely. Together, we are making a significant contribution to the global transformation of the steel industry and the reduction of CO2 emissions.” Green steel: Key lever for decarbonization Schaeffler is pursuing the overarching goal of being completely climate-neutral by 2040. By 2030, the company aims to achieve both climate neutrality in its own production processes (Scope 1 and 2) and a 25 percent reduction in its supply chain emissions (Scope 3 upstream). To achieve these ambitious targets, Schaeffler is focusing systematically on decarbonizing the materials it uses most – including, most notably, steel. Every working day, the company processes roughly an Eiffel Tower’s worth of steel – somewhere in excess of 7,000 tons. The advantage of the green steel purchased from H2 Green Steel is that it has up to 95 percent less embodied CO2 emissions (Scope 3 upstream) than conventional steel produced via the blast furnace route. Andreas Schick, Chief Operating Officer of Schaeffler AG, explained: “For Schaeffler, steel is the decisive lever for decarbonizing our supply chain. The partnership with H2 Green Steel takes us a long way towards our target of climate neutrality. We are proud to be the world’s first tier 1 supplier to be working with H2 Green Steel as a strategic technology partner. This is a sustainable, long-term investment in Schaeffler’s network for this vitally important category of materials.” Find here press photos of Klaus Rosenfeld and Andreas Schick: www.schaeffler.com/en/group/executive-board CLICK HERE FOR LATEST NEWS.

139222627,Wilko: New bid emerges for stricken retail chain,"A fresh rescue bid for Wilko has emerged as efforts to save the retail chain continue. Private equity firm M2 Capital has confirmed it has made a £90m bid for the business, and has pledged to retain all employees' jobs for two years. The bid by M2, first reported by the Guardian, is one of several offers being considered by administrators. Wilko fell into administration earlier this month, putting 12,500 jobs and 400 stores at risk. The administrators for Wilko, PwC, set a deadline of Friday last week for bids for the chain, and are understood to be reviewing offers over the weekend. M2 managing director Robert Mantse told the BBC that if the firm's rescue bid was accepted, M2 would ""guarantee all employees' jobs for two years"". Responding to the news, the national secretary of the GMB union, Andy Prendergast, said that while ""the devil is always in the detail... any bid that guarantees jobs has to be prioritised"". Last week, it also emerged that the owner of HMV, Canadian businessman Doug Putman, is also interested in salvaging some of the Wilko business. However, it is not clear how many stores or jobs would be saved if Mr Putman's bid is successful. Wilko, well known for its affordable everyday items, has been struggling with sharp losses and a cash shortage. It has also been criticised for falling behind rivals such as B&M, Poundland, The Range and Home Bargains, as the high cost of living has pushed shoppers to seek out bargains. Wilko had already borrowed £40m from restructuring specialist Hilco, cut jobs, rejigged its leadership team and sold off a distribution centre as it faced a cash squeeze. Shoppers had also noticed gaps on shelves after Wilko struggled to pay suppliers and at least one credit insurer withdrew trade cover, prompting some companies to pause deliveries. However, Lisa Wilkinson, the retailer's chairwoman until January this year and the granddaughter of the firm's founder, has said ""everybody has thrown everything"" at trying to save the business. In an interview with the Sunday Times, she said: ""The team members, the suppliers, the landlords... everybody has thrown their soul and heart at it."" The company has been criticised for paying dividends in recent years, but Ms Wilkinson said the firm would have collapsed even if it had not made these payments. ""Hindsight is a great bedfellow and I like to think we did all the things we should do when we paid dividends,"" she told the paper. ""The board checked that we'd got profits or reserved profits, there was sufficient cash, we went through the right governance, the auditors checked it off."" She added that if they had not paid any dividends ""it might have made us survive a couple of months longer. What we have taken out really wouldn't have made a difference"". But the GMB union's Andy Prendergast said: ""12,500 workers are facing redundancy - through no fault of their own."" He criticised Ms Wilkinson for her comments, saying she did not ""address her workers and face their concerns"". He added that her remarks were ""in poor taste when workers don't know how they're going to make ends meet in a few weeks' time"". The business was founded in 1930 when JK Wilkinson opened his first store in Leicester. It expanded across the Midlands initially and by the 1990s became one of Britain's fastest-growing retailers. In 2012, Wilkinson began rebranding its stores as Wilko, after its own-brand products marketed under the Wilko name. Are you a Wilko staff member?

139702155,Wilko: Redundancies suspended while rescue bids considered,"Redundancies at collapsed retail chain Wilko have been suspended while rescue bids for the business are considered. The GMB union met with PwC, which is overseeing the sale of the retailer, on Tuesday after calling for an urgent meeting with the business secretary. National secretary Andy Prendergast warned that Wilko was ""not out of the woods yet by any means"". The chain recently collapsed into administration which has put 12,500 jobs at risk. Mr Prendergast acknowledged that while the pause on any potential job losses was a ""positive development"", this is still ""a time of incredible stress and worry"" for staff. About 400 shops across the UK are also at risk of closure. Wilko also operates a head office and two distribution centres. On Monday, the union wrote to business secretary Kemi Badenoch, suggesting that bidders had reported ""difficulties"" engaging with PwC, the administrators. But PwC said it was working ""relentlessly"" to secure a sale of the retailer and ""talks are continuing with a number of parties"". Wilko had been struggling with a cash shortage and a failure to keep up with rivals such as B&M and Poundland as the soaring cost of living has pushed shoppers to seek out bargains. The union asked the business secretary for reassurance that ""all steps will be taken to protect jobs as part of this process"". A government spokesperson said: ""While this is a commercial decision for the company, we understand that this will be a concerning time for workers at Wilko."" The government would ""continue to stand firmly behind business"", having provided support with VAT cuts and business rates holidays in recent years, the spokesperson added. The GMB union also said it was concerned by the influence of Hilco, a restructuring specialist which had already lent Wilko £40m as it was struggling. Reports in the Guardian newspaper suggested that some industry experts were sceptical that a rescue deal would emerge because liquidation might result in a better outcome for Wilko's creditors, such as Hilco. When administrators take over a failed business, they are obligated to try to work out how to get the best return for those that the firm owed money to, as opposed to protecting jobs or keeping shops open. A fresh rescue bid for the retail chain emerged on Sunday, when private equity firm M2 Capital confirmed it had made a £90m bid for the business. It pledged to retain all employees' jobs for two years. The owner of HMV, Canadian businessman Doug Putman, is also interested in salvaging some of the business. PwC said it had been working ""relentlessly"" to secure a sale of the business. ""We are actively engaging with all interested parties and assessing the deliverability of all bids made."" Its spokesman added that it was ""intent on achieving the best outcome for everyone involved"", from creditors to staff. The business was founded in 1930 when JK Wilkinson opened his first store in Leicester. It expanded across the Midlands initially and by the 1990s became one of Britain's fastest-growing retailers. Shoppers had noticed gaps on shelves after Wilko struggled to pay suppliers and at least one credit insurer withdrew trade cover, prompting some companies to pause deliveries.

The company has been criticised for paying millions of pounds in dividends in recent years, but Ms Wilkinson said the firm would have collapsed even if it had not made these payments. ""Hindsight is a great bedfellow and I like to think we did all the things we should do when we paid dividends,"" she told the newspaper.

139939189,Are you ready for HR’s increasingly significant ESG role?,"Talk to a lawyer, and ESG is a legal matter. Talk to an accountant, and it is a finance matter. And, if you talk to a supply chain person, ESG is a transportation matter. While many executives have an opinion on what ESG requirements are, the reality is that it crosses a large number of expertise areas within a firm. Interestingly, HR may have one of the most significant roles to play. ESG by the numbers The three categories of ESG data are best understood as: Environmental: Firms must capture their full environmental footprint. They need to identify their greenhouse gas emissions, trash/scrap generated, water used and/or placed in sewers, etc. This is frequently what people think of when they hear ESG reporting but it is actually just a subset of what is required. Social: Social data requirements are focused on the relationships between a company and its employees, its suppliers’ employees, the communities it impacts, its customers and others. This people and community focus is squarely in HR’s wheelhouse. Governance: These are the controls and other safekeeping protections that help a company maintain an outstanding compliance record in meeting its environmental and social commitments. While a CHRO, and HR generally, may have little responsibility in environmental matters, their roles in the other two pillars will be significant. Mandatory vs. discretionary reporting For many years, organisations have reported a number of discretionary CSR (corporate social reporting) data points. For example, they would mention the awards the company won as a best employer, the diversity of the workforce or its Glassdoor rankings. Some firms touted the charitable acts of their employees while others might have highlighted the firm’s efforts in funding a local community school for disadvantaged children. All of these are good things and certainly should continue but what you must report is now becoming more consistent across companies and more regulated. Mandatory data elements also make it harder for a firm to selectively chose what it does or does not want to report. This is an interesting byproduct of the newer reporting requirements. Now, firms must tell the whole story and not just the best parts of it. The ESG data HR possesses Businesses will likely lean on CHROs and HR organisations to provide a number of data elements for ESG-related reports. HR leaders must identify all of the data points they will need to complete these reports (and that could be a long list!). They will also need to identify where that data exists, if at all, in their current HR, ERP, EHS and other systems. Some values will need to be pulled from a number of subsystems and aggregated while others may require the use of third-party databases (e.g., to get key supplier information) or complex calculations (e.g., You might need to pull paid-time-off usage data from hundreds of workers whose time is in various local payroll systems just to calculate how much total time employees spent on community service initiatives.). And do not forget that some of this data will be in different time zones, languages, currencies, etc. Here is just one challenge: How do you define diversity in all of the countries your firm operates in? HR’s people connections The board will look to HR (and CHROs specifically) to not only pull all of this data together but also to understand, in detail, what suppliers are doing with their workforces and the communities where they operate. No other part of the firm should know more about subjects like engagement, livable wages, ethical behaviour, forced labour, safety incidents, benefits, etc. than HR. HR will likely partner with supply chain/procurement personnel to adjust the firm’s mix of suppliers as new information about those suppliers becomes available. If it does not already, HR should understand the firm’s use of temporary, contracted, 1099 and other non-traditional workers. Are these people receiving a livable wage? What kind of working conditions do they toil in? Another concern area involves the firm’s use of outsourced labour. HR may get tasked to evaluate the working conditions, pay scales, hiring practices, diversity and more that each outsourcer has. Are these firms treating employees (and the communities they live in) fairly? ESG requirements will make HR’s scope and data needs expand materially. A way to look at HR’s ESG concerns In researching a new book on ESG, I noted how consultancy McKinsey, in its 2021 Sustainability Report, wants to “add years to life and life to years.” That concept is not only elegant but highly aspirational. It could also be a great way to frame your initial ESG social efforts. Using McKinsey’s concept, is your firm helping employees and their families: Get access to healthcare? Get access to critical supplies during a pandemic? Acquire elder or childcare? Eat better? Stay fit and exercise? Have a positive mental health? Get time to recharge (e.g., vacations)? Achieve a reasonable work/life balance? These are the programs that should be reported upon. Building off of McKinsey’s prior theme, the next level of reporting might follow this concept: “add years and value to careers.” Is your firm: Providing performance reviews and career plans to all employees at a minimum of once a year? Offering continuing education to employees? Ensuring upward and timely career progression for all employees? Creating a safe place for people to work? Providing relevant and timely reskilling and upskilling opportunities to its staff? Preventing any harassment of employees? Making opportunities for employment and advancement open and equal for everyone? The third level of reporting looks outward. Your firm should look at what is happening to its contracted labour and suppliers’ employees (i.e., add years, life and value to those who serve your firm, directly or indirectly). Does your firm: Avoid any use of slave, prison or forced labour and also prohibit its suppliers from doing so? How many sites did your firm personally inspect last year? Ensure 1099 contract workers are paid living wages and treated fairly? HR’s ESG reporting challenges Sadly, the state of the art for many firms is an annual ESG documentation effort. A team of people are tasked with pulling together the data values needed on specific regulatory reports. The technologies many teams use, if you want to call it that, are spreadsheets and paper. One firm I observed has a team of 14 people who fan out over the firm’s global operations to scour the firm and its systems for key data elements. This takes several weeks at year-end and takes these people away from their regular jobs. They load data into spreadsheets and then merge all of these individual spreadsheets into a cohesive view of the company’s ESG posture. It is an environment rife with double-counting, errors and missing data elements. This approach is not sustainable long-term and may suffer from serious audit/audit trail issues. Other firms are using more automated tools that allow team members to post to a shared ESG data warehouse where the software will automatically map the data to key fields in regulatory reports. The HR ESG strategy Just “reporting” ESG statistics will not cut it long-term. HR will need to be “doing” something about any deficiencies it spots. In fact, the need to be doing something will hit sooner than you think. Why? Once the board or the executive committee has two or more years of statistics handy, they will want HR to dig into the year-over-year (YOY) variances and determine the root causes of these changes. For example, if your engagement slips materially YOY, can you really tell leadership why? Likewise, if you start seeing more suppliers have unacceptable labour practices, is that due to better analytic data or has your firm’s supply chain materially (and unfavourably) changed? You might find problems with new acquisitions, a return-to-office policy or any number of other factors. But, you will need to understand what is changing in your people-based ecosystem. Likewise, HR and HR-IT will need a new technology strategy. The old systems might have been acceptable for capturing data within the firm but do little or nothing to capture external data about contractors, suppliers, etc. Additionally, HR’s IT infrastructure for ESG reporting will likely need a number of new integrations, specialized ESG reporting software, enhanced HR analytic software and more. The long-range goal should be to have an ESG reporting and monitoring environment that: Operates in real-time, not once a year, with real-time (not annual) data; Utilizes detailed, not highly aggregated or averaged, data; Possesses automated process workflows that trigger appropriate HR follow-up; and Detects problems as they are happening, not a year or more after they happened. If you start your ESG (and broader HR) strategy process by determining your future end-state, you will likely focus first on what HR should be doing for the firm and then back into how HR will also support better HR reporting. Stringing together a number of poorly planned incremental reporting efforts regarding ESG will result in a suboptimal solution full of spreadsheets, paper, missing integrations and little added business value. Start your strategy journey by asking questions such as: How can we learn more about all levels of our suppliers? And, if we discover adverse information, how will we deal with it? What should those processes look like? How can we get out of the ESG data collection process and focus HR professionals on the social and governance issues we must address instead? What should we do to have an ESG story that is better than that of some of our suppliers, customers and competitors? What is the state of the art in ESG technology today, and what will this look like in three, five or 10 years? How will specific HR roles change in a more regulated ESG reporting world? What happens to our recruiting and employment brand if we adopt a more ESG-forward posture? Can this help us in our war for talent? Final thoughts ESG requirements are growing rapidly with more countries piling on. The regulatory burden is growing and showing no real sign of abating. Smart companies are getting ahead of this, and smart HR leaders are doing so, too. Consumers are expecting better behaviour from companies regarding ESG matters. And this extends even down to your firm’s recruiting brand. A recent Esker study reported that “employee expectations for sustainability in the workplace are heightening,” meaning that “those companies that do not deliver may undermine their ability to recruit talent, attract investment or win business as a vendor, partner or supplier.”READ MORE: The key questions for recruiters to ask during interviews In fact, the organisation found in a survey that 58% of respondents planned to factor a company’s commitment to sustainability in their choice of employers in the future, up from 44% who considered this before taking their current job. It is especially important to younger workers, with 71% of workers under 35, including 81% of women in this age group, planning to consider sustainability. If your excitement level over generative AI has calmed down, it is time to refocus HR on immediate but strategic challenges—like winning the war for talent, creating resilient organisations, and getting a real plan for ESG.

140121893,"Toyota Plant Shutdown Happened During System Update, Report Says - WorldNewsEra","The company said its global sales had risen 8 percent in July from the same month a year earlier to a record 859,506 vehicles. It also reported a 15 percent increase in global production in that month. The automaker has now posted year-on-year increases in global sales for six straight months, and production increases for seven, highlighting its recovery from last year’s supply chain snarlups and COVID-19 containment measures. Both figures include Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand. Sales in China fell 15 percent in July, contrasting with stronger sales in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. Domestic sales rose 35 percent and those in the U.S. increased by 8 percent. Numbers for August — which will not be available until next month — are likely to be hit by Tuesday’s output suspension. Toyota’s global production is likely to reach around 10.2 million vehicles this year, topping 10 million for the first time, Nikkei reported late on Wednesday. Toyota declined to comment on the projection. The company continues to investigate the cause of Tuesday’s plant malfunction, but has said it was not due to a cyber attack. In February last year, Toyota also had to shut down the same 14 factories in Japan when one of its suppliers, Kojima Industries, which supplies plastic parts and electronic components, said one of its file servers had been infected with a virus that carried an undisclosed threatening message. That attack raised questions about the cybersecurity of Japan’s supply chain. What is Toyota’s production and supplier management system? Toyota essentially invented modern auto assembly with its “kanban” system for notifying suppliers of what parts are needed where and when to minimize inventory. “Kanban” means signboard in Japanese, and the Toyota engineer and later executive, Taichi Ono, who developed the system drew inspiration from watching an American supermarket chain, Piggly Wiggly, manage its shelf stock on a trip to the U.S. in the 1950s. Toyota’s system of lean production and just-in-time parts delivery has been adopted across the auto industry and widely studied. It shifted from a system of printed cards that managed supplier workflow to an internet-based “e-kanban” system more than 20 years ago. Toyota’s kanban system, which relies on simple visual cues to organize workflow, has been adopted for other industries, including software development. What other problems has Toyota faced since its leadership transition? Koji Sato took over from Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda as CEO in April. In the months since, even as the company looks to overhaul its approach to electric vehicles and related manufacturing challenges with an eye on U.S. EV leader Tesla, it has also reported some embarrassing missteps. In April, Toyota said affiliate Daihatsu had rigged part of the door in side-collision safety tests for some 88,000 small cars, most of which were sold under the Toyota brand. In May, Toyota said it had inadvertently exposed customer data on the Internet for more than 2 million Toyota owners because of an error in how it had configured a cloud-based system it uses to track service.",https://worldnewsera.com/automobile/toyota-plant-shutdown-happened-during-system-update-report-says/,https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Toyota%20Motomachi%20plant%20production%202018%20c%20web.jpg,2023-08-31 04:09:31,Evelyn Blackwell,en,us,-0.53
140323855,How Humans Play a Vital Role In An A.I.-Powered Workplace: MIT Professor,"As A.I.-driven changes in the workplace increase in number and scope, there is growing concern over the technology’s impact on employment. However, these concerns can be addressed if we prepare for future changes. While A.I. is eliminating many jobs traditionally filled by humans, history shows that, in the long term, it will create countless new employment opportunities. Moreover, although algorithms outperform people in many areas, human capabilities will remain irreplaceable in the workplace for the foreseeable future. Waves of innovation that bring extreme changes to the workplace are by no means new. Consider, for example, the introduction of containerization in the 1950s. Transporting goods in standardized steel boxes revolutionized international trade. It also eliminated many jobs associated with the manual loading and unloading of cargo. However, containerization also spawned new industries, such as the construction, maintenance, and handling of freight containers, and the development of technology that optimizes how each unit is loaded and tracks the global movement of containers. Similarly, A.I. will create new types of enterprises and job opportunities that we can only imagine today. Also, humans will be an integral part of these future workplaces. Although algorithms are far superior when it comes to performing repetitive tasks, processing vast amounts of data, and identifying key trends and patterns, people will continue to excel in a number of areas. Here are some examples: 1) Real-world experience A lifetime of experience in the physical world allows people to detect changes or discrepancies between normal and abnormal situations. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, companies worried about the financial health of their suppliers. Many companies asked for economic data from suppliers, but these numbers could be manipulated and only provided a lagging, infrequently updated view of conditions at the supplier. To augment the data, companies sent people to spot-check critical suppliers’ production of parts or materials on behalf of the company. 2) A moral perspective Many work tasks involve value judgments and subjective elements based on the system designer’s or manager’s preferences. However, objectives, moral understandings, and preferences change over time. While machines may be able, if appropriately trained, to sift through large amounts of data and present options for actions, people must make the ultimate decisions in cases where the implications matter. This is especially true when the context changes and decisions must be made in a different environment. For example, when prioritizing the response to a disaster, should preference be given to customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, or the community? The honest answer is “it depends” on the nature of the event and the context, which makes it difficult to program or train a model. 3) Adaptability and coordination People are more adaptable than robots when faced with unstructured conditions and environments. Robotic software systems are built and optimized for specific tasks or domains. However, change (disruptions, new knowledge, new products, competitors’ actions, economic cycles, etc.) can render the machine’s appropriateness moot, requiring a person to take over the task. Also, social networks are adept at creating new corporate organizational structures to manage change. This has happened in response to numerous disruptions over recent years, such as the 2011 earthquake in Japan and the Covid-19 pandemic. 4) An in-built creative drive Change that requires adaptation is built into many consumer and technology supply chains, such as fast fashion. These fast-moving supply chains search ceaselessly for differentiation that can spur demand for any new product or service. People, not machines, are part of a cultural milieu that stimulates creativity. Also, humans understand the vagaries of everyday life, and this hands-on experience creates possibilities for new products and services. 5) Empathy and communication While a growing number of A.I. applications are used in health care, computers cannot show the empathy required of a nurse while treating a patient. Likewise, a machine cannot replace the smile of a service worker, such as a cashier in a local supermarket. Similarly, procurement contract negotiations cannot occur without both sides understanding each other, developing rapport, and appreciating each other’s points of view. Even though algorithms that mimic these qualities are becoming increasingly sophisticated, it isn’t easy to imagine absolute acceptance of machine-generated, simulated emotions and empathy. 6) Nuanced risk management While rules can be programmed based on different contexts, the most appropriate choice in a situation that requires a company to select a way forward may differ from the one suggested by the rules. For example, if the company suspects a recession is on the horizon, it may prefer the safer course of action rather than the high-risk/high-reward path. Humans are used to taking such nuances into account when making decisions. Balancing human and machine intelligence The vital challenge for societies as A.I. advances is how to create workplaces that enable humans and machines to work alongside each other—not in competition. This can be achieved in various ways. For example, data analyzed by A.I.-based models can be sent to human decision-makers for action. Chipmaker Intel uses this approach in its procurement operations. Its A.I. system provides a mass of data, such as supplier performance reports, that help procurement managers make sourcing decisions. Another method is to deploy A.I.-infused automation technology to carry out most of the work. Humans intervene when a machine fails or cannot recognize that the context has changed (e.g., a system has been hacked or a pandemic has erupted, requiring the mode of operation to change). The flexibility of human employees is needed to pivot quickly when such changes occur. Anxieties over the rise of A.I. are legitimate, and the technology will transform the world of work. However, it is vitally important that we take a balanced view of A.I.’s potential and its impact on employment.

141348101,"Meet Hilco, the firm behind the scenes at Wilko failure and other high street collapses","It has been a tough few weeks for staff at Wilko, with the first round of potentially thousands of job cuts at the failed budget retailer due to start this week despite hopes remaining of a rescue deal for parts of the business. However, the picture is rosier for its biggest creditor, the restructuring specialist Hilco Capital, which in recent years has made its name through dealings with some of the best-known British retailers, from Habitat to Homebase. The fund lent £40m to Wilko in January and is now the chain’s biggest creditor after the pension fund. That puts it near the top of the queue of individuals and businesses, from staff to suppliers, awaiting their share of any cash that can be salvaged from a sale or breakup of the business. The process is being run by administrators at PwC, who must exercise their duties for the benefit of creditors as a whole, giving due preference to those with security over Wilko’s assets, including Hilco. However, Hilco has a dual role in events: it is not only a creditor, but also a paid adviser to the administrators, helping them to value and sell the stock, a key factor in ensuring that the debt is paid off. While there is no suggestion that PwC would favour one creditor any more than it is legally bound to, Hilco has secured a significant position in the process and the GMB union representing Wilko’s shop workers has raised concerns about a conflict of interest. Sources close to PwC told the Sunday Times that it worked with all liquidation firms and did not give Hilco preferential treatment. The fund is also operating in the background at another distressed retailer, Superdry, which last month borrowed £25m from Hilco. The loan is expensive – the British fashion brand will pay 10.5% above the Bank of England base rate, currently 5.25%, giving a total rate of almost 16%, if it draws down any of the money. Superdry’s problems were highlighted last week when it was forced to suspend its shares as auditors pored over its accounts. Results released on Friday revealed falling sales and profits. Shares were unsuspended on Monday and promptly fell more than 10% to a record low. The loan is the latest in a run of retail deals that Hilco has been involved in over the past year, as the big high-street names struggle with the impact of Covid and years of attrition of online sales. Hilco bought Cath Kidston in June last year before selling it on to Next in March; it provided funding for the tailor Gieves & Hawkes in June 2022, before the brand was sold to the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, that November. It also handed a £15m lifeline in July 2020 to French Connection, which was sold the following year after its sales and share price plunged. The Hilco model is effective. It offers retailers a helping hand by lending money when normal banks won’t – at a price – but it is also potentially benefits when companies fail, collecting fees from advising on and handling the sale of assets for administrators or taking control of a company and selling off the assets directly. It cleared the stock for administrators to Debenhams, BHS and Woolworths, and owns the DIY chain Homebase and the Denby Pottery Company after snapping them up in tough times. Hilco’s most recent full accounts published at Companies House show that it made a pre-tax profit of £3.1m for the year to December, down from £9.4m the year before. Despite that dive in profits, it dished out dividends of £7.1m, compared with £6.4m in the previous period, most of which will have gone to executive chair and main shareholder, Paul McGowan. He and former Harrods boss Paul Taylor set up Hilco Capital in 2000 as a London arm of the US restructuring firm of the same name. Hilco initially specialised in valuing and selling off stock, but now offers a much wider range of services, and in some cases acts more like a private equity fund, acquiring and managing businesses. It bought Homebase for £1 in 2018 from Australia’s Bunnings and loaned it hundreds of millions to facilitate a turnaround. Last year, Homebase paid off £132m of a parent company loan valued at £600m on its books and also handed more than £3m in consultancy fees and brand royalties to companies controlled by Hilco. That came after Homebase’s profits rose 18% to £55.6m, partly as a result of one-off benefits from property sales and government support, including more than £2m in Covid support grants. While many businesses that accepted government support during the pandemic showed restraint on dividends, Hilco appears to have taken a different tack. In 2020, its owners paid themselves £25m in dividends on top of £12m related to advisory services and brand ownership fees, while its Bathstore business accepted £30m in business rates relief and another £10.6m in furlough payments and grants, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Hilco also rejigged and sold on include Habitat, selling its website and main stores in 2011 for £24m to the then owner of Argos and Homebase. Argos and Habitat have since been bought by Sainsbury’s. The demise of Woolworths illustrates Hilco’s flexibility. The firm had struck a deal to buy its 800 stores for £1, taking on at least £265m of Woolworths’ £385m debts. However, the group’s creditors decided they would benefit more from a breakup, and Hilco was then hired by administrators to help manage the retailer’s exit from the high street. The GMB, which represents thousands of workers at Wilko, has raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest in the chain’s administration process, with the union’s national secretary, Andy Prendergast, saying: “Hilco cannot be a neutral party if they are owed money.” Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, suggests there are “inbuilt conflicts of interest”. He says buying the debt enables Hilco to get a handle on the details of how a business is faring and then work out how to profit from that. “If they put money in, they can put themselves in the driving seat and are at the top of creditors’ batting order when it goes into administration.” Hyman thinks the arrangement puts staff at a disadvantage: “People are not taken into account. Suppliers can probably figure out what is happening at a company, but if you are one of the staff, you can’t, which makes staff more vulnerable.” Nick Hood, an independent restructuring expert, says Hilco has a strong reputation in realising the value of stock and faces little competition from companies who could handle the same scale of operations. Given that administrators have a duty to get the best value for creditors, Hilco’s track record makes it the obvious choice. “Hilco’s operating model,” says Hood, “is to insinuate themselves to the point where they become indispensable.” Hilco declined to comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/04/hilco-wilko-high-street-retailers,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c5627bede0b7e0d605df3d4f141da6db9b44c54/407_351_4009_2407/master/4009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZ,2023-09-04 19:21:32,Sarah Butler and Joe Middleton,en,gb,-0.375
141688723,Vietnamese firms are yet to find their competitive edge from FDI spillovers,"Authors: Trung Nguyen, Quyen Dang, Erhan Atay, RMIT Vietnam Vietnam is one of the great economic success stories of the past 35 years, having turned some US$450 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) into major gross domestic product and other gains. The country remains a leading destination for inward FDI, attracting global giants such as Samsung, Intel, LG, Toyota and Lego. FDI is an attractive mechanism for developing countries because of its positive spillover effects, including technological advancements, skill transfers, managerial expertise and value chain integration. These spillovers occur through interactions with multinational enterprises (MNEs), from supplier relationships and through learning and competition within the domestic market. Over time, domestic firms grow more competitive, and this enables them to move up the value chain and compete with MNEs. But available evidence suggests Vietnam has seen little of this spillover phenomenon. While Vietnam has observed some positive externalities such as job creation and record growth of the digital economy over the past five years, these gains have not lived up to expectations and have failed to harness the country’s full potential. Local firms in the manufacturing sector have limited connections with FDI firms, making the economy overly reliant on FDI for exports. FDI generates over 70 per cent of Vietnam’s total export value — indicating a lack of comparable growth and development for local firms. Domestic firms generally face challenges in enhancing their absorptive capacity when FDI firms are present in the market, but it appears the Vietnam case is particularly severe. There are limited transfers of technology from FDI companies to local firms and Vietnam’s manufacturing sector has notably low productivity. Only a limited number of Vietnamese firms have managed to upgrade their position in the global value chain. As a result, their roles are mainly confined to providing input materials or low-value-added tasks, leading to fragmented and inefficient linkages and externalities. One senior Vietnamese employee at a supplier of Samsung stated that although such an arrangement can offer major benefits, these are only accessible to a small fraction of the approximately 900,000 enterprises in Vietnam. For instance, in 2020, Apple sourced AirPods from 21 suppliers in the country, but none of them were Vietnamese. There are several reasons for the limited spillover effects from Vietnam’s major FDI flows. Government policies have long appeared to focus more on quantity than on quality. Regulations on technology transfer were not strictly applied. Combined with public mismanagement in several cases, this has led to low-tech FDIs proliferating through the economy. A large number of FDI firms prioritise simple technologies to take advantage of Vietnam’s market size and potential as well as the country’s low labour costs. Another reason spillover has been minimal is that firms in Vietnam have a relatively short history of development compared to their peers. The imposition of a nationwide command economy right after the country’s unification in 1975 hindered the development of the private sector. Though this strategic mistake began to be corrected with the introduction of the Doi Moi policy in 1986, Vietnamese enterprises still have less market experience compared to their peers in the region and their corporate governance is much poorer as a result. In addition, private firms encounter various challenges in Vietnam, notably accessing capital and formal loans. To cope, many turn to informal channels with higher rates. High logistics expenses and petty corruption with government agencies hamper local firms’ competitiveness on the global stage. Finally, there are still gaps between the government’s ambitions and the reality of implementation management in the public sector. Many of these challenges are man-made and can be addressed through effective policies and disciplined implementation. Vietnam possesses unique advantages, including its strategic location in Southeast Asia, a young and adaptable population, a politically stable environment, impressive innovation performance, a thriving digital economy and an open economy with multiple free trade agreements. To fully leverage these advantages and promote positive externalities, especially in building strong local firms, Hanoi should prioritise investment in human capital by implementing a comprehensive national training program on digital competence. This will facilitate the successful implementation of the national 4.0 strategy and support both the digital and green transformations. Targeted and comprehensive investment in digital, transport, energy and other key infrastructure will also improve domestic firms’ competitiveness and further motivate the workforce. This can be enhanced by promoting a more functional bureaucracy through better pay and accountability. Hanoi may look to others in Asia — Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea — to see the advantages of digitalising government services to promote business efficiency, as well as the benefits of digital disruption for emerging value chains. Vietnam must also improve the business environment and establish a level-playing field by enacting laws pertaining to state-owned enterprises, and position Vietnam as a regional hub to attract MNE headquarters and research and innovation centres. While Vietnam has been an attractive destination for FDI firms, local firms have not fully realised the desired benefits. Overcoming these hurdles with the right strategy in place can strengthen local firms and lead to greater success.
