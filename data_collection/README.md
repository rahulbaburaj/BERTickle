# Data Collection Module

This module focuses on fetching news and data from various sources, including but not limited to worldnewsapi, newsapi, the Economic Intelligence Unit, and Twitter. The architecture ensures easy extensibility to include more data sources in the future.

## System Architecture Overview
1. **Connectors**: This folder will house individual connectors to different news/data sources. Each connector is responsible for fetching data, converting it into a standard format (NewsArticle model), and handling API-specific nuances like pagination or rate limits. They inherit from base_connector.py to maintain a consistent interface.

2. **Models**: This contains the standard representations for the data we fetch. Even though different sources might have varied data formats, models ensure we have a unified structure for downstream tasks.

3. **Utils**: It has utility functions related to API interactions, like rate limiting, retries, and error handling. These utilities make the connectors concise and focused on fetching data.

4. **Config**: It contains configuration details that the connectors would need, such as base URLs, endpoints, etc. Do not store sensitive information like API keys directly here; use environment variables.

## Contribution Guide
1. **Adding New Connectors**:
- Create a new Python file within the connectors/ directory.
- Ensure your connector inherits from BaseConnector in base_connector.py.
- Implement necessary methods and use utility functions from utils/ as required.
- Update config.py with any necessary endpoints or configurations.

2. **Extending Utility Functions**:
- If there's a common functionality or error handling mechanism you think can benefit multiple connectors, consider adding it to utils/api_utils.py.

3. **Models**:
- If introducing a new data source that doesn't fit the existing models, create a new model inside models/.
- Ensure compatibility with existing models if possible.

4. **Testing**:
- Add unit tests for any new connectors or utilities you introduce.
- Ensure all existing tests pass before making a pull request.

5. **Documentation**:
- Update this README or any relevant documentation when making significant changes.
